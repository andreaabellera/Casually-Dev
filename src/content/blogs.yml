    blurb: "<span class='taviraj'><b>Brain at 2am:</b> You should have branded qtrlex.ca as qtrl.exe, missed opportunity <br>
    <b>Me to brain:</b> I hate you </span>
    <br><br>
    <i> Fortunately, there cannot be a domain with the ending .exe so I am safe. Take that, brain </i>
    <br><br>
    So goals, what do we have here? I formulated a list and whoa. There's quite a lot so let's break them into categories!
    <br><br>
    <br><span class='laBelleAurore large'> Life Goals </span><br>
    <ul>
    <li> Prioritize work, family, and exec duties over qtrlex. Very important. If life picks up and I slack in meeting goals, that's alright. It will be a stretch to fulfill everything on the list. Things won't always go as planned and expectations can be arranged or shifted. That's why there's going to be retros 😊 </li>
    <li> Maintain a healthy spiritual life. Paramount. Reach 2100 verses </li>
    <li> Need to get some of my gals together to play Minecraft </li>
    <li> Meet my team, continue meeting new people and older friends! </li>
    <li> Explore resources and practice for future tech interviews </li>
    <li> Buy an ipad possibly 💝 </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br><span class='laBelleAurore large'> Content and Site Goals </span><br>
    <ul>
    <li> Post at least 1 new algorithm or data structure journal study every week </li>
    <li> Write up to 3 pages for the <i> Competitive Programming Handbook </i> and <i> Casually Art Manuals </i>, seek contributors as well! </li>
    <li> Review 15 drinks and develop a 'Drink Leaderboard' in Revues </li>
    <li> Develop La Ruelle Charmante ('The Charming Road') timeline aspect of my virtual portfolio </li>
    <li> Develop the Galerie and have at least 3 collections and at least 20 cumulative artifacts to exhibit </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br><span class='laBelleAurore large'> Dev Milestone Goals </span><br>
    <ul>
    <li> Ready Casually CSS for distribution and launch a publicity campaign (details on an upcoming blog post) </li>
    <li> The lone adventurer in myself seeks to join a CSS artist's guild if one of such fabled orders exist.. </li>
    <li> Develop an app with SOL (Solana or Solidity, whichever I get first 😉) </li>
    <li> Inspired to refute a Reddit claim that you cannot make a game with just HTML and CSS, I will make a logical game with just HTML and CSS... </li>
    <li> A retrospective blog post exploring current progress and accomplishments of goals on the beginning week of each month </li>
    <li> Beyond summer, I may evaluate new milestones for life's next page </li>
    </ul>"

    blurb: "Nice to see you here! 
    My name is Andrea Abellera and I'll share a little about myself as the author-dev of qtrlex. 
    I study Computer Science and am known to some peers as a developer, designer, and artist. 
    Outside my laptop, I am a coffee, tea, and spicy food enjoyer. I am a secretly a plant and must be kept under natural light. Maybe I am a dog too because I need to go for walks. 
    I also am a writer, singer, and lady apologist in training ⚔️✝️ 
    <br><br>
    I built my qtrlex blogsite from scratch using Svelte, a Node.js web anti-framework which the vanilla component artist in me approves. As of yesterday, the alpha site got prepped and ready yet short of hitting my MVP goals. But hey, while this site stays still obscure, let me roll in my faux backend infrastructure and portfolio updates along with my first few content plans 🤭
    <br><br>
    <span class='lancelot x-large'> What will be in qtrlex? </span>
    <br><br>
    Presently, qtrlex has 2 active (Blog and Journals) and 2 inactive (Galerie and Revues) streams of content. 
    Down the road, I may consider adding new streams such as a Resources or Friend Feature page, but for this summer, we prioritize activating all four!
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li> <span class='laBelleAurore large'> Blogs </span> - stream for updates, stories, and thoughts on Life 💃🏻, Develop ⚙️, Programming 👩🏻‍💻, Art 🖼️, Games 🎲, or Random 🍡 for miscellaneous shenanigans </li>
      <li> <span class='laBelleAurore large'> Journals </span> - stream for sharing guides, tutorials, studies, and other educational content </li>
      <li> <span class='laBelleAurore large'> Galerie </span> - stream for exhibiting my original artwork and some photos </li>
      <li> <span class='laBelleAurore large'> Revues </span> - stream for drink reviews. This may extend to food too </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Personal summer goals going live on my next post! 🌿"
