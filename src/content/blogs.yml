    blurb: "Terraria is a land of adventure! 
    A land of mystery!
    A land that's yours to shape, defend, and enjoy. Your options in Terraria are limitless.
    Are you an action gamer with an itchy trigger finger? A master builder? A collector? An explorer? There's something for everyone. 
    Start by building basic shelter, then dig for ore and other resources. 
    Discover and craft over 500 weapons of magic, ranged, melee and summon varieties, as well as armor, and use them to battle hundreds of different enemies. 
    Soon you'll be going head-to-head with any of a dozen enormous bosses. Go fishing, ride a mount, find Floating Islands, build houses for helpful NPCs, and much, much more."

    blurb: "In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks and simple machines. 
    Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode where players have unlimited resources and access to flight. 
    Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets."

    blurb: "Ang socket ay masakit, 
    kailangan mo kalasin
    ang socket na masakit
    kundi masasaktan ka rin

    Napakasakit kumonekta
    sa socket na masakit
    Nakukuryente kita
    Kapag ako'y nakakabit

    Kailan kakalasin
    ang socket na masakim

    Kailan ako kakawala?
    kung di ako aapila

    Kailan kakaltasan
    ang kapos kapalaran

    Kakayanan ko'y kaltasan
    kapag hindi kinabukasan
    Tiwala'y kinakaya kita
    kahit di ko mabata"
