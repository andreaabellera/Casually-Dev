    blurb: "Terraria is a land of <span class='laBelleAurore x-large'> adventure.</span> A land of <span class='taviraj large'> mystery.</span>
    A land that's yours to shape, defend, and enjoy. Your options in Terraria are limitless.<br><br>
    Are you an action gamer with an itchy trigger finger? A master builder? A collector? An explorer? There's something for everyone. 
    Start by building basic shelter, then dig for ore and other resources. 
    Discover and craft over 500 weapons of magic, ranged, melee and summon varieties, as well as armor, and use them to battle hundreds of different enemies. 
    Soon you'll be going head-to-head with any of a dozen enormous bosses. Go fishing, ride a mount, find Floating Islands, build houses for helpful NPCs, and much, much more."

    blurb: "In Minecraft, players explore a blocky, procedurally generated 3D world with virtually infinite terrain, and may discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks and simple machines. 
    Depending on game mode, players can fight computer-controlled mobs, as well as cooperate with or compete against other players in the same world. Game modes include a survival mode, in which players must acquire resources to build the world and maintain health, and a creative mode where players have unlimited resources and access to flight. 
    Players can modify the game to create new gameplay mechanics, items, and assets."

    blurb: "<span class='cousine slightLarge'> import socket </span><br><br>

    Ang socket ay masakit, <br>
    kailangan mo kalasin <br>
    ang socket na masakit <br>
    kundi masasaktan ka rin <br><br>
    
    Napakasakit kumonekta <br>
    sa socket na masakit <br>
    Nakukuryente kita <br>
    Kapag ako'y nakakabit <br><br>

    Kailan kakalasin <br>
    ang socket na masakim <br><br>

    Kailan ako kakawala? <br>
    kung di ako aapila <br><br>

    Kailan kakaltasan <br>
    ang kapos kapalaran <br><br>

    Kakayanan ko'y kaltasan <br>
    kapag hindi kinabukasan <br>
    Tiwala'y kinakaya kita <br>
    kahit di ko mabata"
