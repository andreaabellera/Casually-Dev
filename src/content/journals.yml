    title: Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm Study
    date: May 12, 2022
    blurb: "Alpha–beta pruning is a search algorithm that seeks to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree. 
    It is an adversarial search algorithm used commonly for machine playing of two-player games (Tic-tac-toe, Chess, Connect 4, etc.). 
    It stops evaluating a move when at least one possibility has been found that proves the move to be worse than a previously examined move. 
    Such moves need not be evaluated further. When applied to a standard minimax tree, it returns the same move as minimax would, but prunes away branches that cannot possibly influence the final decision. <br><br>

    title: Merkle DAG Data Structure Study
    date: May 12, 2022
    blurb: "When we represent graphs on a computer, we don’t have the luxury of drawing arrows; 
    we have to encode our data structure by providing a concrete representation of its nodes and edges. 
    Since CIDs can uniquely identify a node, we can use them to express an edge from one node to another. 
    By doing so we create a special sort of DAG known as a Merkle DAG, in honor of the researcher who first described such structures. <br><br>
