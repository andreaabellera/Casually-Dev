    blurb: "As part of the qtrlex project and preparation for the upcoming school term, I collected and surveyed resources that will make good references for my journal studies. My plans for my journal studies are predominantly geared to warm-up on data structures, learning best solutions to common patterns that are prevalent in competitive programming, and discovering how these well-known algorithms work. I have always thought that a Leetcode grind is the way, but grinding hours a day will not teach me new things per se. Thus, I'm trying an journal study plan to not only prepare myself for future programming contests and tech interviews, but also to assess a good curriculum to train other students with and to merit my own contributions to the <span class='cousine'><b>Breaking into Competitive Programming Handbook</b></span>.
    <br><br>
My experience in competitive programming had been fairly new. A colleague of mine founded a programming chapter wherewith I was able to help leading. As one with no prior competitive programming knowledge, he handed me a really good textbook that I had not had the chance to go through due to a saturation of commitments last year. I revisited the textbook today and in addition, compiled books, guides, and online courses. I will try some out (Educative's Grokking the Coding Interview and the HackerRank's C++ Course are on the top) and will endorse those that I find to be most beneficial. To my delight, these resources guided me to some good starting points! I will write my first journal entry today brushing up on <span class='cousine'><b>Breadth-First Search</b></span> and <span class='cousine'><b>Depth-First Search</b></span> as these are foundational to traversals and sets. These will also ease me in to optimized graph algorithms which I aim study down the road."

    blurb: "Today's a little different. I had an adventure and went to campus today! 
    I love bussing, even if it takes me two rides. I've been used to commuting far and in the Phil, I loved the jeepneys and tricycles that took me to school and back. My favorite part is choosing stopovers: whether it be the city center, a mall, a marketplace, a clubhouse and I can grab all the supplies I need and snag whichever of the 1768+ street foods I crave.

    I usually stay in our university club lounges where I'm able to secure a working spot with an added value of meeting new people! As such, I met some racecar building engineers in one. In another, I met a friend in our Computer Science lounge who gave me an orange because I did not pack lunch 😆 I met another friend later on who let me try riding his electric scooter. I was barely able to stay on but it was fun 🐒 Finally, I attended my university's Women in Computer Science first orientation. I met lots old friends and women my junior with so much potential! Oh yeah, I've been sipping tea and noticing an influx of commentary by adults about TechLead's tweets and watching them spar on LinkedIn. I used to stumble by TechLead and watch some of his Youtube vids, got bad track record for demeaning a peer years ago, and lately has just been shooting his foot. A woman's competence will speak for itself, can't stop a girl who loves to code from coding, and tech is a great career choice for its flexibility. Although frankly, I would want my prowess and needs to be valued by my counterpart rather than demeaned. If I'm a mom, I'm willing to sacrifice my career given my spouse earns as my duty to family comes first. I'm not a mom, this is not a concern yet 😂 I bussed home with a good friend. After full day of remote work and activities, I did not realize how tired I was. Surely enough, I crash landed on bed. But hey, now I'm up again to write this blog (yay!) and do a survey. I'll take another nap before I follow with next commits, it's 6am 😜"

    blurb: "<span class='taviraj'><b>Thought of the day:</b> Is it possible to 'color in' an svg shape with a fractal pattern? I can imagine these adourning dresses and clothing with elaborate and potentially animated patterns. Thinking about it, this can make good journal studies for the future - a deep dive study of the anatomy of an .svg file, and exploring an algorithm or library that can procedurally generate artistic patterns </span>

    <br><br>
    If you have explored Chez Moi and scrolled down further, you will see my banner for Casually CSS. It is a passion project of mine that features individual works as a gallery, and also allows devs to import fun CSS artworks in future use cases!
    <br><br>
    <b><i> Sounds crazy, what's the advantage of CSS art over existing vector formats like svg?</b></i><br>
    Good question, the main advantage, while not completely implemented yet, is props passing. Do you want to change the color of a bike? Change its rear wheel size? brand name? Auto-animate its wheels or make it only animatable by hover? A pre-packaged library offers a fast way of getting fun, customizable, and interactive art on your site with minimal graphics knowledge. Second is robustness. I used a protected device with a firewall once that blocks most content, including fetches from the IPFS. I opened my qtrlex site and none of the images were loaded but to my thrill, the artworks remained intact as they are coming straight from the installed node modules! Third, to share the fun and love of the niche art of CSS. With this, I'd share a little bit of backstory.
    <br><br>
    I started making my CSS artworks last June 2021. I was a developer in my first internship and discovered that I can make very interesting edge shapes with border radius, stack elements on top of each other with absolute, and lay elements down concisely with grids. 
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    I started to create common objects, my first one being a spinning <a href='https://andreaabellera.github.io/Casually-CSS/#orange'> orange </a>. Then, I made a <a href='https://andreaabellera.github.io/Casually-CSS/#boba'> boba </a> drink. I was exhilerated, became extra ambitious and made an <a href='https://andreaabellera.github.io/Casually-CSS/#octopus'> octopus </a> the following day. I shew a friend my creations and took requests so that I can make more artworks!
    <br><br>

    <br><br>
    Hence, the idea of Casually CSS is born. I revisited the project after school, warmed up my rustiness by making a few pieces, improved the gallery UI, and looked into npm packaging. It was a thrilling adventure but it's just the beginning! 
    <br><br>
    My dream that this can one day become an open source CSS artwork library is coming to life before my eyes but this is just the conception. Only a few friends of mine know of this project in terms of publicity, had one good friend contribute fun character names, and no usages I am aware of as of yet. To prepare Casually CSS for the world, I made some development plans which I hope to document as I blog with qtrlex!
    <br><br>
    <span class='laBelleAurore large'> Preparation </span>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li> Prepare the first 5 package-friendly artworks for global usage. Yes, for me this means reworking the artworks - changing the ems to exs and grid constraints to percentages to make them as consistent as possible when plastered over the smallest to largest containers </li>
    <li> Make a class or function for each artwork so they will be convenient to import from a node framework (like React). Svelte components are super easy - it takes the HTML and CSS as is. As they are convenient to recycle and pass props to (like changing a size or color), these are already being used around the qtrlex site 😊 </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <span class='laBelleAurore large'> Publicity </span>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li> Create a teaser video and 'jingle' that I can post to my LinkedIn </li>
    <li> Start sharing my project to student communities and social spaces </li>
    <li> Join feature trains </li>
    <li> Push Casually CSS to collections of open-source resources </li>
    <li> Create a hyperrealistic CSS painting as a ticket to join famed CSS Artists in their guild </li>
    <li> Super wild idea - take a speedcoding video of my artmaking process, play with final results, and have these shorts up on Tiktok 😆</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <span class='laBelleAurore large'> Enhancements </span>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li> Improve the gallery UI again. Include artwork ratio and availability of the artwork in the package </li>
    <li> Look into eliminating 'grid lines' in artworks. Grid lines appear most prominently in parts of an artwork that are animated. Nothing significant can be done as most Casually artworks are grid-based but can look into alternative strategies of making art (like single-div) </li>
    <li> Actions to automate npm packaging. Right now, I package the library manually. There's benefits to automation for sure, but I'd also like to be wary of tradeoffs or considerations (e.g. Do I necessarily want a new version everytime a commit to main is made?) </li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    I'd take this moment now to admit something honestly. I am a young dev, I do not have it all together, and most times I have absolutely no idea what I'm doing. The open source world is a new world to me and I am a stray branch trying to graft myself into a tree. If you happen to be a kind stranger passing by with advice on your pocket for strategy, development, or even just general encouragement, please dont hesitate to contact me as I would really love to hear it 🤍"

    blurb: "<span class='taviraj'><b>Brain at 2am:</b> You should have branded qtrlex.ca as qtrl.exe, missed opportunity <br>
    <b>Me to brain:</b> I hate you </span>
    <br><br>
    <i> Fortunately, there cannot be a domain with the ending .exe so I am safe. Take that, brain </i>
    <br><br>
    So goals, what do we have here? I formulated a list and whoa. There's quite a lot so let's break them into categories!
    <br><br>
    <br><span class='laBelleAurore large'> Life Goals </span><br>
    <ul>
    <li> Prioritize work, family, and exec duties over qtrlex. Very important. If life picks up and I slack in meeting goals, that's alright. It will be a stretch to fulfill everything on the list. Things won't always go as planned and expectations can be arranged or shifted. That's why there's going to be retros 😊 </li>
    <li> Maintain a healthy spiritual life. Paramount. Reach 2100 verses </li>
    <li> Need to get some of my gals together to play Minecraft </li>
    <li> Meet my team, continue meeting new people and older friends! </li>
    <li> Explore resources and practice for future tech interviews </li>
    <li> Buy an ipad possibly 💝 </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br><span class='laBelleAurore large'> Content and Site Goals </span><br>
    <ul>
    <li> Post at least 1 new algorithm or data structure journal study every week </li>
    <li> Write up to 3 pages for the <i> Competitive Programming Handbook </i> and <i> Casually Art Manuals </i>, seek contributors as well! </li>
    <li> Review 15 drinks and develop a 'Drink Leaderboard' in Revues </li>
    <li> Develop La Ruelle Charmante ('The Charming Road') timeline aspect of my virtual portfolio </li>
    <li> Develop the Galerie and have at least 3 collections and at least 20 cumulative artifacts to exhibit </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br><span class='laBelleAurore large'> Dev Milestone Goals </span><br>
    <ul>
    <li> Ready Casually CSS for distribution and launch a publicity campaign (details on an upcoming blog post) </li>
    <li> The lone adventurer in myself seeks to join a CSS artist's guild if one of such fabled orders exist.. </li>
    <li> Develop an app with SOL (Solana or Solidity, whichever I get first 😉) </li>
    <li> Based on progress with Casually CSS, start scoping for viability of Casually Components </li>
    <li> Inspired to refute a Reddit claim that you cannot make a game with just HTML and CSS, I will make a logical game with just HTML and CSS... </li>
    <li> A retrospective blog post exploring current progress and accomplishments of goals on the beginning week of each month </li>
    <li> Beyond summer, I may evaluate new milestones for life's next page </li>

    blurb: "Nice to see you here! 
    My name is Andrea Abellera and I'll share a little about myself as the author-dev of qtrlex. 
    I study Computer Science and am known to some peers as a developer, designer, and artist. 
    Outside my laptop, I am a coffee, tea, and spicy food enjoyer. I am a secretly a plant and must be kept under natural light. Maybe I am a dog too because I need to go for walks. 
    I also am a writer, singer, and lady apologist in training ⚔️✝️ 
    <br><br>
    I built my qtrlex blogsite from scratch using Svelte, a Node.js web anti-framework which the vanilla component artist in me approves. As of yesterday, the alpha site got prepped and ready yet short of hitting my MVP goals. But hey, while this site stays still obscure, let me roll in my faux backend infrastructure and portfolio updates along with my first few content plans 🤭
    <br><br>
    <span class='lancelot x-large'> What will be in qtrlex? </span>
    <br><br>
    Presently, qtrlex has 2 active (Blog and Journals) and 2 inactive (Galerie and Revues) streams of content. 
    Down the road, I may consider adding new streams such as a Resources or Friend Feature page, but for this summer, we prioritize activating all four!
    <br>
    <ul>
      <li> <span class='laBelleAurore large'> Blogs </span> - stream for updates, stories, and thoughts on Life 💃🏻, Develop ⚙️, Programming 👩🏻‍💻, Art 🖼️, Games 🎲, or Random 🍡 for miscellaneous shenanigans </li>
      <li> <span class='laBelleAurore large'> Journals </span> - stream for sharing guides, tutorials, studies, and other educational content </li>
      <li> <span class='laBelleAurore large'> Galerie </span> - stream for exhibiting my original artwork and some photos </li>
      <li> <span class='laBelleAurore large'> Revues </span> - stream for drink reviews. This may extend to food too </li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Personal summer goals going live on my next post! 🌿"
