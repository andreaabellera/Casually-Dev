    blurb: I used to find all coffee taste the same. Wherever I get them, whatever they are called. Then I started drink adventuring, alas. Needless, double double is my go-to. Ratings are trivial because I will not resist any coffee plopped in front of me and as much as I try different drinks, in my core, I love basic coffee.

    title: Caramel Macchiato
    detail: Starbucks
    blurb: Sweet, sumptuous, creamy, yummy, and heartwarming. It's a drink I'd recommend often, because this coffee feels like home. It's not too bitter to jolt people not used to coffee. Not too sweet to the degree of a blonde vanilla latte. Generally the likeable friend in the world of cafes.

    detail: Jeepney
    blurb: Dude, first sip and all my insides rejoiced in harmony - it is that good! Savored it to its last. Milo is not your classic chocolate flavoring, it has a creamy malt essence to it. And boy, give it some cheese and I call it a winner. Just a chef's kiss perfect sweet and lightly salty treat, I'm giving kudos to Jeepney for coming up with this groundshaker.

    detail: Starbucks(steamed milk base), Panda Tea(green tea base) - same rating
    blurb: This drink hug your soul. It will soothe you, and comfort you, affectionately stroke your back, tell you everything is alright. You are loved and cherished. There is no more sadness. Only hot-to-warm milk and delectable matcha. And then you start tasting the matcha sediments at the bottom and wonder where did all the drink go.

    title: Strawberry AÃ§ai Refresher 
    detail: Starbucks
    blurb: THE OG. Other refreshers took its place as my favorite but this DRINK for starting everything. My poor self couldn't imagine affording Starbucks and used to ignore the chains. But at the first sip of SAR, my standards are forever altered. In my second year in uni, I would hardcore farm for Starbucks cards to buy the smallest Strawberry Acai Refreshers. While half a dollar cheaper from the next size up, smalls (ironically called Tall) are barely anything but it was enough for me. After I finish the lightly caffeinated exquisite strawberry tea soup, there'd still be a ton of ice and strawberry slices left in the cup. I would snack on them in lectures, I'd snack on them while coding. I'd snack on them and live my best life. Crispy strawberries are godly, soggy strawberries are yucky. The drink soup is sweet and yummy with a slight bitter tang but it is divine.

    title: Chocolate Creme Cold Brew
    detail: Starbucks
    blurb: Second time I got the drink, I decided this is so good for what it's worth and bumped the number up. At first, I thought it would benefit from a little more chocolate. Too much coffee, to little chocolate. Then I realized this is cold brew, not iced mocha. Chocolate's an accent, and this may be, in fact, better than mocha! It has chocolate foam on top- which is ABSOLUTELY bussing. The rest will melt into the iced drink and the subtle cocoa tones will make the brew a treat.

PS, I am not South Asian and I know not of what's true chai and subpar western chai so I dare ya enlighten me. Note - Apparently spicy chai spoiled me that I don't appreciate non-spicy chai as much.

    title: Strawberry Coconut Drink
    detail: Starbucks
    blurb: Hot take, why is it a full point lower than Strawberry Acai Refresher? The drink is objectively good. It's SAR without the bitter tang and creamier. I'd call it the queen of sweet fruity teas. So it should be better, right? Theoretically, yes. But for me, the addition of coconut milk loads and saturates the drink and robs the refreshing exquisite iced tea experience that's otherwise in unmodded SAR.

    blurb: It is absolutely refreshing. I'm glad I took an uncommon flavor.. reminds me of a long lost friend in pomelo. The yoghurt blended with the drink 100% so grapefruit's bitter taste is nullified. What's left is a citrusy drink that's enjoyable with them pearls! While I usually grab tea over juice, I'd give this what it's worth.

It's too sweet though. I can't taste the lemon. I can't taste any fruit. I don't know where pink came from. But it was good.

    title: Black Tea Lemonade
    detail: Starbucks
    blurb: I'm old before realizing that Nestea juice boxes and restaurant iced tea fountain drinks I grew up with are actually - technically - Black teas. Those same teas along the Orange Pekoe and Earl Grey family line, but with ice! I'm so slow. Anyway, my thoughts trying Black Tea Lemonade. It tastes like Brisk half Iced tea, half Lemonade, the ones you get in Costco fountains or as big bottles in Safeway. But it's on a high-end cup. So it tastes fresher and more authentic! In a way I guess, but still the same. Due to its familiarity, I won't recommend but I'd love this every now and then as a feel-happy drink.

BOY, it changed my mind completely. Now I love my hot milk teas especially if it is called London Fog (which is Earl Grey with cream and foam)

    blurb: Honestly, just get a triple triple from McDo or Tims. While Starbuck's White Mocha Sauce is fantastic, I thought it would be better as a pump than the highlight. This drink is just too rahrahrah sweet that masked Starbuck's signature kick, drink got demoted to fastfood counter coffee.

    detail: Starbucks
    blurb: A new drink after my fave color! But I'm not gonna be biased. Okay, drinking this refresher is like eating a pineapple without chewing it. The infusions are just redundant versions of the drink, they taste the same if not a little bitter. Super sweet and good after a run, but otherwise I find it too pretentious.

    title: Mango Dragonfruit Refresher
    detail: Starbucks
    blurb: A refresher I instantly loved on first try. I would alternate this with Starberry Acai Refresher but eventually I ended up preferring this a bit. Okay, I am from the Philippines, I am a sop for mango juice. Our mango juice is either puree-like (very concentrated) or artificially flavored in kids' Zest-Os. There's no inbetween. But the MDR base is a type of un-mango (it's translucent white lol) that's groundbreaking. I sometimes ask for extra of this juice. The dragonfruit inclusions are sweet, and small, and cronchy (unless they are soggy), I call them "bonbons". 100% snackable with ice. I love this drink to bits.

The caramel crunchie additions stay very defined and crunchy even if it's submerged in the shake or chills by the whip cream on the cup sides. After finishing the drink shake, you can still enjoy it to the last crunchie.

The oreo crumbs aren't as enjoyable as a texture as they're too frail. The drink's already chocolatey, they don't add value like in boba teas. Get largest size unless you want it to go quickly.

Kiwi starfruit of itself is sour. Kiwi with lemonade and is throat suicide. But kiwi with coconut milk, THIS, is perfectly balanced. The tea soup is divine, like green apple. The infusions are sour but I grew to like it with the tea soup. Like sour candies. Not long, all other refreshers became subpar. Nothing beat the character of the Star drink. I would finish a Trente and I'd want another Trente. I won't know Heaven in my lifetime but if I can attribute one thing on earth to heaven I pick this.
