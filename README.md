## Hi, I'm Andrea! üçµ
Come one, come all to **qtrlex**, Andrea's personal blog, portfolio, girl cave! This will be my summer pilot project integrating content creation to my lifestyle. In **qtrlex**, I will write about my development experiences and milestones, share verses and stories, journal my programming studies, post art and photos, vent on life (moderately), and include anything that I'd be inclined to POST! 

Appearances of other names and faces will only be done with consent. Mentions of interactions or other perspectives will be coded with common terms as "friend" and "colleague"

> **qtrlex:** Quaintrelle's Expo but abbreviated by some dork. I pronounce it as {con-trol-ex}, like the keyboard shortcut, but variations like {quayn-tre-lex} or {cutie-arrgh-lex} are also cool

## Let me Know of Funny Things Ensuing üëÄ
Does pressing something break the view on your phone? Perhaps your browser will not load images or throws some errors? Open an issue [here](https://github.com/andreaabellera/qtrlex/issues) with your browser and browser version so that I can take a look

##  Reproduce the Site ‚öíÔ∏è
Since the site is open source, all production code is available in this repository. Clone, fork, or download this repo and enter these commands to run the site locally
1. Open a terminal, go to the **qtrlex** directory, and run `npm install` 
2. Enter `npm run dev`

You can replicate, modify or improve the stack, look and feel of the **qtrlex** site for yourself ‚ù§

*But the development journey and lessons learned from building the site is mine mueheheh*
