# qtrlex.ca
## Launching @ MAY 23
Woot woot! Let's go

## Hi, I'm Andrea! Welcome to qtrlex
I am excited to present to you **qtrlex**, my personal blogsite and portfolio! This will be my summer pilot project integrating content creation with lifestyle. **qtrlex** will be my personal girl cave where I would write about my development experiences and milestones, share verses and stories, journal my programming studies, post art and photos, vent on life (moderately), and include anything that I'd be inclined to share! 

Appearances of other names and faces will only be done with consent. Mentions of interactions or other perspectives will be coded with common terms as "friend" and "colleague"

> **qtrlex:** Some geek's way to say Quaintrelle's Expo. I like pronouncing it as {con-trol-ex}, like the keyboard short=>cut, but variations like {quayn-tre-lex} or {cutie-arrgh-lex} are fantastic

## Let me Know of Funny Things Ensuing
Does pressing something break the view on your phone? Perhaps your browser will not load images or throws some errors? Open an issue [here](https://github.com/andreaabellera/qtrlex/issues) with your browser and browser version so that I can take a look

##  Reproduce the Site!
Since the site is open source, all production code is available in this repository. Clone, fork, or download this repo and enter these commands to run the site locally
1. Open a terminal, go to the qtrlex directory, and run `npm install` 
2. Enter `npm run dev`

You can replicate, modify or improve the stack, look and feel of the qtrlex site for yourself ‚ù§

*But the development journey and lessons learned from building the site is mine mueheheh*
