WEBVTT - This file has cues.

00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
Using your own FONT for a website

00:03.500 --> 00:07.000
First, we'd need an .otf or .ttf font file

00:05.000 --> 00:07.000
You can download a free font or make your own!

00:07.200 --> 00:10.500
I recommend calligraphr.com as a free font builder

00:11.000 --> 00:13.500
It gives a template you can draw on then turns it into a font file

00:14.500 --> 00:15.500
Here's some of my custom fonts ğŸ™‚

00:19.000 --> 00:24.000
Let's start adding them to our website's CSS

00:25.400 --> 00:28.000
Add @font-face to the top of your styles

00:28.500 --> 00:31.500
`src` is the location of font relative to styles file 

00:32.000 --> 00:34.500
`font-family` is a string that will be our font's unique name

00:36.500 --> 00:38.500
Let's import all 3 fonts!

00:42.500 --> 00:43.500
Here's a standard HTML layout

00:45.500 --> 00:47.700
Add `font-family` property towards your chosen font name

00:48.200 --> 00:49.000
Let's see it in action!

00:57.500 --> 01:00.000
All set! ğŸ˜Š
