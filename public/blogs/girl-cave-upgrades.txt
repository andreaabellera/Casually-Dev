My cave got vamped and the last two core streams of content for this site have been activated. I am very happy! Meet my new pages.
<br><br>

<span class='lancelot x-large'> Galerie </span>
<br><br>

The Galerie is where I share my artworks, traditional and digital. They are predominantly a mix of my paintings and character concept art. Most of my artworks are a handful of years old. My art energy has been repurposed for work, development, and clubs. Ah being an adult. But I tell ya after graduating, watch your coins for the next webtoon hit!
<br><br>

One huge motivation for my decentralized content management is that some of my blogs and art will contain religious Christian content. Christianity slandered in my department's Discord server near regularly by the same people who says they want to make the department a welcoming place.
But here in my cave, I will post the objects of my conviction without qualms.

A lil' story behind this piece. In my Grade 12 art class, our term focus was to create art inspired from any ancient mythology in different media. 
Our choice of mythology will be consistent throughout the term. As much as I enjoyed Riordan's early series, I was inclined to choose Christian myths as knowing deep inside that these are not mythology to me. In making art, the subject of the piece I create is very meaningful so why not make it about something I love.
My art teacher constantly expresses comments in private that are surprisingly in-context. "I love how you use different perspectives in each new piece. In this (top orthographic view of a leather craft depicting crucified Christ), I see the Father looking down to His Son". While creating the Broken and Bleeding piece, my art teacher told me something that stuck with me. "Don't let people in university sway your faith. Your teachers will convince you against it. They will do everything to turn you away from it."
He's def one goated teacher. He bought my last sketchbook assignment (which is a painting of him). I got paid art commissions by a handful school staff. I was an oddball in high school but I had a vibrant and miraculous journey.

In a decentralized system, no entity, authority, or mob can take these stuff down. Although people can still take away jobs, education privilages, or marr reputation, I do not fear losing any of mine. As Isaiah would often say, they all <a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Isaiah-50-9/">shall wax old as a garment and the moth shall eat them up</a>. The poor here gains more.

Finally, drink reviews are here! They have taken over my hobby of art. I need them coffees and teas in my life.
I do webdev at work. Outside work, I do a project that involves webdev. And another project that involves webdev. And two more projects that are also webdev. In the next months I'm going to do more webdev. 
I eat webdev for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I need a (safe) drink. I plead my case.
<br><br>

I have 20+ drinks reviewed, most of them are ones I found pictures for. There's even more! Since there'd be a lot of drink entries, I'd add filters, categorize the leaderboard, and add a search function - all be for the next girl cave upgrade!
