This blog post is dedicated to one of my recent favorite games, Crusader Kings 3.
<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/">You can buy it here on Steam</a>. It's slightly pricey but you get to be a king, reshape the medieval world, and birth many kids and marry them off so you can expect more grandkids! They will take your place when you get sick, old, and die. The game continues while your lineage does. Truly, there's really no objective in this game but to immerse yourself, war to grow your territory, micromanage your realm, have warm feelings, make smart or stupid decisions, and be genuinely surprised. Like your baby grandaughter speaking in fluent English and stopping your hand from eating soup.

<br><br>

I would not call this game addictive, as there is no "hook" <i>*wink*</i> that demands you to be online or else you miss out. That's what I like. It's undemanding and completely self-paced. However, I can also sink hours at a time for no rational reason. Do I want to eat up that kingdom at my side? The reasons for ending a game, likewise, do not need to be justifiable.

<ul>
<li> I formed an empire and I'm bored </li>
<li> I united something and I'm bored </li>
<li> I'm an awesome ruler, I died and I'm bored </li>
</ul>

<br>
Needless to enjoy your game, you can whip up goals or simply watch things unfold. I have my share of playthroughs and will share a few stories to form the remainder of my blog. Warning: Just like every other blog, it's a geeky dump!
<br><br>

<h2 class='lancelot x-large'> I. The Impaler of Iberia </h2>
<br>

Attracted by the prospect of a harder game, I tried one of the preset characters with Infanta Urraca, a temple holder in a fragmented Iberia. When her father died, the Spanish thrones split between her brothers. She got the mice's share on a deal with a brother she shares the bed with, and your brothers and set on discovering your scandal and blackmailing you for it. It was an interesting albeit difficult start.
<br><br>

In my strategy, I started stewardship lifestyle to survive on money and later switched to intrigue. And I did learn.. <b>Skullduggery lifestyle is fun.</b> Your best bet is to scheme to kill your brothers to inherit their thrones for yourself, and skullduggery boosts your capacity to do that.
<br><br>

Urraca went wild and killed her brothers, brothers' children, brothers' childrens' children to gain more titles. A spymaster with 24 intrigue was my MVP. It struck me how ill-prepared Castille royals are for their lives. From 1096 to 1100, there is new Spanish death each year. Nobody would suspect me, a good Catholic temple holder. I wot my husband's +100 opinion modifier is him saying, "Thank God, you haven't killed me yet."
<br><br>

<br><br>
Despite the successful playthrough, I had a few lessons for the future.
<br><br>

I could've killed or broke up with my brother-lover from the get-go but decided against it. I realized life is hard to be incestous, not so much for the hooks everyone gets at you but moreso the limited chance to have kids. Urraca starts in her mid-30's with only a decade left to bear children. Precious pregnancy windows were spent bearing my brother's children instead of my rightful husband's who could've passed his positive congenital traits, rather than the negative traits from incest.
<br><br>

<br><br>
I won an intrigue challenge and my feast cook shew me his secret recipe that involves humans. Alas, I executed him. I wish I had chosen to eat his stew and became a Cannibal instead.
<br><br>

My playthrough ended after queen Urraca died. The throne is passed to my hunchbacked son, Roy. He has this oranged-hair hunchbacked son who I think is really cute. Look at him bend forward slightly, he looks like a programmer!
<br><br>

<br><br>

<h2 class='lancelot x-large'> II. Beautiful Senseless Bohemia </h2>
<br>

This is my first playthrough where I tried a custom ruler I for the first time. This is Salome of the dynasty Ronova.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Because I am running Bohemia, I must play tall. I gave her a stewardship focus and background.
<br><br>

I took a husband who was incredibly sweet. He suggested to name our first daughter after me. It was adorable!
<br><br>

<br><br>
He also suggested to name our next daughter Salome. My dear. Now, that's patronizing.
<br><br>

<br><br>
For Slovianska's sake, why torture yourself with three Salomes in the household? How could you call the right one? *shakes head* My husband, Petar: compassionate, robust guy. High stewardship, with 24 prowess. My best knight in my earliest battles. Love that man. When he died, I got hurt inside.
<br><br>

<br><br>
My queen died a ripe old age which went quite far despite her possessed lunacy. The two kingdoms I held were divided between my two sons. I became Hermes who's 50 years old. His brother, Rhian, was in his 30's and is quite the looker. Alas, I had to take his kingdom away and give it to my son, Treise.
<br><br>

Treise and descendants just made the kingdom large. I realized it was harder to expand in feudal Slavia compared to my Daura run in Africa. Duchies are hard to claim, composed of many 4-5 counties per duchy, as opposed to Africa's 2-3 counties per duchy and tribal style.
<br><br>

Positively correlated with territory, my dynasty grew large as well. Eventually, I got tired of thinking of nice names for kids. After I named a man Python, everything went downhill. Children that followed him started becoming.. technical. Java, Javascript, Cobol, Assembly, OCaml! Even my heir was not safe, but he got a great name at least.
<br><br>

<br><br>
My lovely daughter Vue is wearing green. It's coincidental.

<br><br>
Sons are normally desirable for dynasty growth but daughters worked in favor of mine. I had no shortage of naming opportunities and went nuts naming my grandkids. I ended my playthrough after I run out of programming languages and frameworks by memory to name the kids. Truly the best reason to sunset the Bohemian saga.

<br><br>

<h2 class='lancelot x-large'> III. Aetrusian World Peace </h2>
<br>

I realize small-to-big playthroughs are cool. You start a count or duke then work your way up to an emperor. Games often end when I form an empire and it's heedless after that. So, I'd chug that by starting this next game off as an empire.
<br><br>

I custom created Lovelien Diceris, one of my book protagonists, translating her character appearance and traits in-game as I depict her in my story. I have the 'Quicksilver Princess' section of my <a href="/galerie">Galerie</a> dedicated to hold her concept artworks.
<br><br>

<img src='https://dweb.link/ipfs/bafybeiclhauxoavbqvfwmnvhzawjqwnlqofix53rlo6ok4w3x6elzqciou' alt='Lovelien concept art by me, 2021' style='height: 100%; width: 100%;' class='blogImg' />

<br><br>
Lovelien is the daughter of an Aetrusian ambassador who dreams of world peace. She is instated as the empress of the Aetrusian empire. Can a beautiful, nurturing, risk-averse woman bring peace to the world one day? That, we will see.
<br><br>

<img src='https://dweb.link/ipfs/bafybeig2tinhcqztcyfbbva6and3k7fcte26jt54kqijeih673h42m4fim' alt='Lovelien Diceris in character builder' style='height: 100%; width: 100%;' class='blogImg' />

<br><br>
Despite an Byzantine empress start, Lovelien had a rocky beginning. She is the epitome of all things not glamorous as a Byzantine. She entered a loveless marriage with a homosexual man. Her priest hates her and gives Byzantine Empire claims to everyone because a woman on a throne is a shame. She cannot perform Byzantine's signature torture rite without staking her poor heart.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Peace at last. She passed the throne to her son, Sylvanus. Life is good, he enjoyed hunting a lot. The throne was then passed to Serapion, a craven man who gets heart attacks on hunts and anticipates to get home everytime. His notable successor is Serapion II, a Sadistic, Brave emperor that's got capped dread for days. He is Lovelien's opposite, the epitome of all good things Byzantine. He can extort courtiers and castrate at will, but <i>can peace truly be bought by tyranny?</i> Clearly not in Lovelien's book. He passed the throne to a toddler, Laurentios, who lost the empire to his aunt and became a despot (king, which is of lower rank than emperor), but regained his emperor title much later. After him's a beautiful diplomatic man, Stephanos, who got deposed from a rebellion. His beautiful son named Gabriel ascended in his stead, an absolute heartrob that slightly backfired with a Lover's pox. But God said "cover that", and gave him a neat beard.
<br><br>

<br><br>
From my playthrough so far, I learned that my favorite part of the game is no longer conquering territory, but looking after your dynasty. Unlike the Bohemians, I intentionally give my dynasty kids good names. Only when I'm exasperated do I give a troll name. 
<br><br>

I named a boy Despot. I granted him a kingdom so that he can be called Despot Despot. Surely enough, his son named Job-Well Diceris inherited his father's title and tried to start a faction after my throne. Well, sorry uncle Job-Well. It will do you better to simply... do your job well. AHAHAHA.
<br><br>

<br><br>
Gabriel married an African princess and begot this half Euro, half African baby son - and I was lovestruck. This little guy is reminiscent of my original character, Magnus Ganardor. The succession line shifted to him - automatically - without needing to disinherit my oldest son. This means that when myself, Gabriel, dies, I will play Magnus. Peak Aetrusian playthrough moment. Consider that my first queen is Lovelien - named after my OC. So is my last king, Magnus - will also named after my OC. I can't by all logic say how much this means to me. Below are concept art of Magnus, many years back before I started playing Crusader Kings.

<br><br>
Gabriel died organically from a ripe old age when Magnus is young. The transition went smoothly as I learned that good vassal opinion (likewise, bad opinion) is inherited in part.
<br><br>

<br><br>
It is likely that Magnus is going to be my last king, and he will complete Lovelien's original vision for world peace. Magnus decided that world peace can be achieved by establishing a new ecumenical religion named World Peace, embrace Pacifism, and have all my vassals from coast to coast agree for conversion to the religion of the Pacifist.

<br><br>
My queen is an Aquitane's princess with no good or bad congenital traits, just an average spouse by the book. She gave me lots of children in a short span of time and that honestly impressed me. I no longer want to divorce for the sake of genetics or statsmaxing. Instead, she became my soulmate. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
We have 8 sons and 1 daughter - a bunch of rambunctious redheads. I love them all so much. When I die, they all can be despots and despotissas. The brothers may be backstabbing each other for land after I die. But I, Magnus, shall enter the Pearly Gates having achieved world peace. This world and my children shall no longer be my problem.

<br><br>
As if it wasn't enough that Magnus rules the earth's largest empire, or that he established world peace, or that he has a soulmate for a wife, or that he has many children from the same mother.... Magnus also has a dog! I named the dog Meuly, a befitting name for the sweetest badoogie! (Meuly is the name of our IRL family dog)
<br><br>

<h3 class='taviraj large'> Barbershop Fun </h3>
<br>

The Barbershop is Crusader King's in-game character customization tool for group shots. I cannot use it and not be a little carried away. <b>Magnus will narrate to give context in the following screenshots.</b>
<br><br>

<br><br>
I, Magnus was so happy when Agnès got pregnant with our first child. When Adoniram was born, we dressed up in Aetrusia's finest regalias and let the empire know of our house's majesty. 
<br><br>

<br><br>
We made an ensemble that will make Paradox proud - "Yes, yes, this is what we made the game for!" Behold, the paragons of Aetrusian virtue, your Crusader King and Queen! The champions of Orthodox Christianity. My wife is a Cynical Catholic French and I am a Zealous Orthodox Greek. We have our bumps from our differences, but my wife's willing conversion was one of the easier days. She also had her turn to laugh, proud of me after I.. *cries in zealous grief* reformed the faith of my fathers. There was a small retribution, I made Gluttonous a sin and darling, it's not personal! I refuse to call you obese but that's an objective fact. I thought she'd be convicted to get fit, but now she's eating more out of spite.

<br><br>
No, I don't travel around the marketplace with my cape all day as the great basileus, I could show you otherwise. Here, we opted for a laid back attire befitting a casual activity such as going to a medieval fair. Ah, to not be a basileus for a day! Ah, to enjoy family time! My baby son wants to try hunting. Dad handled a bow before and will show you how it's done.

Woohoo, bravo Adoniram! The arrow fell at 90 degrees trajectory off the string you barely pulled. My expectations are not astronomical for a cute toddler. Papa and mama are proud!

<br><br>
Adoniram has grown up and is now a big kid. I, Magnus, seem to be ageless, as should be when you are a Pacifist living a peaceful life.

<br><br>
Here is the world map showing the Diceris domain from the northern borders of Mongolia to the eastern coast of my mother's homeland in Africa. My fellow emperor and older brother rules Mongolian tribes and has formed the cadet branch, Diceris-Yaffa. Of all colors, he chose yellow to go against my indigo landmass. What atrocity! But, I love you, my brother. I am a Pacifist and will not go back on my word. I may diplomatically challenge myself to negotiate a color change, but keep your land.
<br><br><br>

<h3 class='taviraj large'><i> Fin </i></h3>
<br>

Short games, long games, are good games alike. The games themselves are not dead as the only way a Crusader Kings playthrough will end is when you have no more lineage or the wrong people in your succession inherits your throne. But for a reason or another, I decided our stories reached their end. We murdered our entire brotherly kin, populated West Slavia with frameworks, and achieved medieval United Nations. My rulers thank your time for reading their stories and have some enlightening last words to share.
