Today, I am taking on something more fun than personality quizzes! I stumbled by this concept as I was doing some article reading on <i><span class='laBelleAurore'>*bashfully smirks*</span></i> Medium. I decided to give <a href="https://brenebrown.com/resources/dare-to-lead-list-of-values/">Bren√© Brown's list of values</a> a shot after I've witnessed a couple of authors (of whom many are in the technology sector as well) do personal reflection on their values based on this list. One completed example is <a href="https://blog.colinbreck.com/understanding-our-core-values-an-exercise-for-individuals-and-teams/#fn1">Colin Breck's article</a>. 
<br><br>

The following shall be my own.

<br>
<h2 class='lancelot x-large'> My Top 13 </h2>
<br>

I identified 13 values that jumped off to me. I find a lot of values to be self-explanatory. Of course I value Love! But I abstained from highlighting it, because others resonated with me stronger with their specificity. Kindness for example, I would have thought it's a given. Until I found myself in situations looking back and thinking, I wish I had been more kind. Which made me value this even more than it used to be because it is no longer something I see as granted. "Be Kind", is one of Bell: Let's Talk's campaign stickers. I would stack this one up. There was a semester I wore a flower band in my right arm regularly to remind me to be kind. There is strong, personal nuance in some of these values.

<br>
<h2 class='lancelot x-large'> My Top 3 </h2>
<br>

I narrowed down my 13 to 3. While my goal is to reduce this to 2, I found myself on a standstill as I consider how my three top values play into my life.

<br><br>
<h3 class='taviraj large'> I. Beauty </h3>
<br>

I can have a number one value, it is Beauty. I have a double take as deciding this as a top value because this would, on impression, make me seem shallow and vain. But it is meaningful and far from it. Taking this off my list feels wrong and inauthentic, because looking back, a lot of my activities and inclinations has always been geared to its pursuit. So, I'll expound instead.
<br><br>

I see Beauty as the epitome of living. There is no point in anything, if we cannot appreciate what we worked for. When God finished his creation, he discerns it, "and God saw that it was good." I want to create something, or go through an experience, and see "that it was good". I love to as much as possible hone the beauty of the world around me. Beautiful art, beautiful music, beautiful stories, people beautiful in their differences. I want to physically present myself beautiful. I want my presentations to be beautiful. I want work, activities, and plans executed beautifully. Systems to be well-oiled, efficient. Smooth, enjoyable, like a chef's kiss - muah - <i>Beautiful!</i>
<br><br>

I'm an artist and would consider myself a generalist. I'll pick up any medium in my reach to produce art. I love drawing and conceptualizing, which later turned to digital illustration and painting, which later turned to coding, which later turned to UI design, CSS art, which later turned to shooting reels. Artists express a thought photographically to paper or digital canvas, whether it is referenced from the mind or pre-existing visible items. They can extrapolate, manipulate, add more elements, dexterously working with shapes, proportions, layers, hue, saturation. Artists can use any medium, different mediums may mean different application styles and operating stages. Yet, it for any permutation of medium, you will always have vision + style = art. A vision is an invisible thought. The artist's style makes it visible. An artist derives merit and credibility when their style and execution is considered beautiful.
<br><br>

The upside of Beauty is that it is intricate and nurturing.
It treats matters with craft and care.
<br><br>

But the tradeback of Beauty is perfectionism and desiring validation.
<br><br>

As a child, I had an irrational fear of mangled posters. Politicians put their faces as posters in my local vicinities and after elections, those posters inadvertently get torn down and vandalized, and I cannot stand to look at them. It scares the lifeblood off me.
<br><br>

I no longer hold this irrational fear, but had a time my Youtube feed was invaded by recommendations for facial disfiguration surgeries, I caved back to my child and wiped all the data Google has on me to reset my recommends.
<br><br>

My mother has always called me a perfectionist. When a crayon goes off the lineart boundaries, I get miffed considering it ruins my work. On exams, I wanted serial straight 100's. I stay in my room and spend my time drawing my alternate designs for an event to a game I'm enjoying. The first time I sang solo and my parents recorded me, the recording came out distorted due to mishandling of speakers and I wept hearing it played back. In giving a declamation once and singing the ending jingle, I croaked a terrible vibrato and the classroom laughed, then I sprinted off. Eventually, I matured and accepted mis-executions as part of life. I hold lesser claim to perfectionism to describe me, yet, I will always be reminded of it as a crippling trait that holds me back. There is a fear to be laughed at, or for work to be seen as lackluster. It holds me back from happiness when a single thing goes wrong. It paralyzes me to never stop working on something that is supposed to be good enough. The next value that I learned patched this and gave me what I needed.

<br><br>
<h3 class='taviraj large'> II. Courage </h3>
<br>

Courage is my forward agent, the force that makes me go. Just. Do. It. Don't care what people think, don't care if you'll be laughed at. Get that idea from the backburner to the door to the street. Take that baton and put order to the mess. Derive the results you wanted. The force actualization that turns the intangible to tangible. Beauty is fearful and self-conscious, but Courage nullifies it.

<br><br>
<h3 class='taviraj large'> III. Wisdom </h3>
<br>

Beauty and Courage without Wisdom is Vain and Overbearing. Wisdom is the stabilizer, which strikes me off my high horse and grounds me to humanity. Grounds me to the limitations of myself and others. Grounds me when I'm dissatisfied, when I'm overwhelmed. I believe that Wisdom is divine. 
"If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God" (James 1:5), it is inextricable from faith, and faith is the substance of your sacrifice and stake for hope. Wisdom helps me to love, helps me to forgive, to cast of my hypocrisy. Wisdom is the value I kept highlighted as it is best reflects the trait that can subdue my other two. It reminds me that what I want is not what matters in the grand scheme of things, but what God wills.
<br><br>

Wisdom is emotional and spiritual maturity.

<br><br>
<h2 class='lancelot x-large'> Top 2: Beauty and Wisdom </h2>
<br>

There we have it! It almost sounds cheesy but hey, values don't lie. I want to be a pretty and wise lady! Ultimately, I saw that Courage has been derived from Wisdom.
<br><br>

<b><i>In many ways, my two core values are like anti-matters.</i></b>
<br><br>

Beauty is my Idealist.<br>
Wisdom is my Pragmatist.
<br><br>

Beauty is Ambitious.<br>
Wisdom is Content.
<br><br>

Beauty wants to be lauded.<br>
Wisdom wants to keep low.
<br><br>

<b><i>But they can also work together.</i></b>
<br><br>

Beauty forms my vision.<br>
Wisdom forms my action.
<br><br>

Beauty and Wisdom are constructive forces. They are intricate, careful, and well thought out. While I am known by others to be fast and decisive for efficiency, for bigger matters, I ponder further.
<br><br>

When I look into enjoying more of life, I see myself pursuing more beauty and be wise in its pursuit. I have one life, and I want my life to be a beautiful story. I want to experience balance and love, strive for competence to give, unlock new adventures, new gains, new losses, because all these things are beautiful. 
<br><br>

I thought I must plot out all my battle plans and details. It turns out, the most beautiful outcomes come through the stakes of faith. I can allow myself to be disappointed, in order to be pleasantly surprised.
