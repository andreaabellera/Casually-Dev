This year will mark my graduation, a culmination of five years in university. I am no longer the person I used to be and it is something to celebrate because this Andrea is a grown woman. Experience shapes, and time tells. A long-term retrospective post is daring in the highest order but a free day does wonders. I go through this post exploring two questions: <b>1.) what changed?</b> and <b>2.) what did I learn?</b>
<br><br>

What Changed?
</span>
<br><br>

<span class='taviraj large'>
I. Myself
</span>
<br>

All my life, I believed I was an introvert. Hey, that's even one of my secret motivations for wanting to be a programmer - because I'm terrible talking to people! It took me through the isolation of pandemic to learn that I may be an extrovert. It depressed me to not meet people. It struck me that I had a propensity to work in bustling, noisy places. I found that I immensely enjoy talking to new people and planning hangouts. And that I may have had held a gift in excelling in what extroverts do, but I stayed too long believing otherwise.

II. My Art
</span>
<br>

When I was in my teens, I was obsessed with drawing - <a href="https://www.casually.dev/galerie"> producing much of my pieces in my Galerie</a>. Fast forward five years, I no longer dedicate my time to draw. I feel a vital piece of what I used to be was stripped away. I no longer have most of my materials. Yet, I still have my love and my skill for art. But it is that my craft changed over time - from drawing to development. I may or may not be the smae CasuallyDev in another 5 years and I accept that! I am not bound to this identity nor a single channel of content.

III. Meritocratic Worldview
</span>
<br>

One of my classes' readings introduces the Myth of Meritocracy, which despite being a woman in Computer Science, I found at first disagreeing with. I have often considered myself meritocratic coming from a background that has little odds of making it. My counterpoint is antithetical to the claim of the reading. Meritocracy, as I've thought of it, will give me an equal playing field with everyone. It doesn't matter if I'm poor, or I'm a girl, or I have no mentors, or no experience. If I can be smart and passionate to match up, then I can make it. It has always been an attractive prospect. I just have to be better than the median, or better than most, or better than enough - and I will land a job as a programmer.
<br><br>
At 2021, a dream of a lifetime came true. I worked my first development job, a position I was unqualified for. The cloud of inadequacy that plagued my young self has been lifted. I cherish the people who gave me the chance. I always thought giving the lesser a chance is too socially-serving. But rethinking, we are all mortals that thrive through grace. Every living person had at least one good thing done to them in their lifetime that they did not deserve at the moment. As such, I am very grateful, though I still held pieces of that worldview until later. What completely dispelled my worldview of meritocracy is a hard truth in my final year - that sometimes the most qualified people do not deserve to be where they are. In contrariwise, I observed some who are undeserving are the ones who did wonders under their term.
<br><br>

<span class='lancelot x-large'>
What Did I Learn?
</span>
<br><br>

<span class='taviraj large'>
I. Create, even if you don't get feedback
</span>
<br>
Even if no one seems to care. Even if you don't get to do it often enough. Even if it doesn't seem original enough to merit. Even if you think it's not polished enough. When you create something for others or for yourself, you make your world and their world a little bit brighter. Your humanity allows others to appreciate their own humanity. You don't know who's watching you. You don't know who'll stumble by your work, get a chuckle, or love it genuinely. Create, it is worth it!
<br><br>

<span class='taviraj large'>
II. Be kind, whatever the cost
</span>
<br>
Even if you are disappointed, frustrated, angry, grieving, hurt, betrayed. Whatever the cost, be kind. Be slow to speak. Never attack another man's dignity. It's never worth the price to momentarily relieve by letting out your monster. The tongue is an unruly evil, set in the fire of hell, and you will give account for the lives you destroy with words alone.
<br><br>

<span class='taviraj large'>
III. You are not the Savior of another man's dreams or misgivings
</span>
<br>
It will not make you more of a noble friend but it will cost you everything.
<br><br>

<span class='taviraj large'>
IV. Power and position is overrated
</span>
<br>
Guess what! Climb that ladder. Tell me now if it was worth it to work with equally insufferable people. Tell me now if they, or you for that matter, actually deserve to be leading. Tell me now how it feels to be on a pedestal where the weight of your failures, incapabilities, and sins are magnified. Now, tell me how often you can find those rare gems of people who may have a lower profile, but are full of humility and the value they exude is immense that can trust them with anything. Strive to be them.
<br><br>

<span class='taviraj large'>
V. Do not live to prove yourself
</span>
<br>
There's a part of us that wants to impress, to be esteemed, to be chosen. Because deep down, we are pick me's at heart. That job, accolade, rank, achievement, that notion of being ahead, that other person's favor. If you want it to prove something, none of it will matter.
<br><br>

<span class='taviraj large'>
VI. Forgive yourself for failing
</span>
<br>
The least you can do is be nice to yourself, when the world isn't.
<br><br>

<span class='taviraj large'>
VII. Forgive others, always
</span>
<br>
Peace is the most valuable treasure that any two people can have together. Even if it is not reciprocated from the other side, you keep your peace of mind.
