I'll share Toronto Survival tips for those exploring the city because safety comes first!
<br><br>
<ol>
<li> Avoid the area "Jane and Finch". It's the crime hotspot of the city </li>
<li> Always go with the crowd on the subway. Do not be alone </li>
<li> There are many train and bus networks known by different names running their own systems. You get tickets from dispenser machines or Shoppers Drug marts. Find station guides, they will help you with routes and give you a map </li>
<li> Have an Uber app. There'd always be an Uber within a few minutes when desperation or panic hits prime </li>
</ol>

For the past five days, half our family explored Toronto and surrounding areas for a survey trip that ended up bringing a new type of experience.
<br><br>
For one, we met our first ever known family in Canada who are distant relatives. They learned of my provicial migration and hosted our family for a few days during our trip.
Both parents are solid Filipinos, very hospitable and chatty. With big dinners and "chikahan" that are stories all the way past 12.
The dad is my mom's aunt's husband. For simplicity, we call him the Filipino word for uncle - "Tito". Our Tito pour out anecdotes like Niagara falls, which we went to one weekend.

<br><br>
My brother and I sat on a sofa as he told us all his story after story. The existence of this blog tells you that I learned a thing or two. Or several, because he is such a veteran soul.
<br><br>

Own an Electric Car? Nah
</h2>
<br>

Tito's passion is studying and fixing cars. He loves his bare hands on the metal, the scent of oil and grease. If he can work after retirement, he'd happily live the rest of his life a car mechanic.
In the family, he is the maintenance engineer and the others ".. are like pilots. They just ride and go", he laughs.
<br><br>
He taught me and my brother the basics of automobiles. As a car noob myself, I'm down for his longest TED talks.
I learned that car engines can go from having 4-cylinder to 24-cylinders, or rotary. Cars have a triangle of life - air, fuel, and fire. Without one, a car won't start. 
<br><br>
I asked what he thought of electric cars, to which he replied,
<br><br>
"They're boring. You plug them in, then plug them out. And that's it". 
On top of being boring, electric cars with sparse charging stations are severely unreliable for long drives. Whatever you save for hybrid cars, whose concept is to use electricty for slow runs within the city and gasoline for long and speedy highways, are offset by the phenomenal price of batteries.
<br><br>
My mom is the true detective. For every Uber ride we have, she'll sit shotgun and converse with the drivers who in turn happily share their Toronto tips, stories, and observations. We uncover many transportation saving tips, location cues, and insider info like how much a Tesla costs to rent. 
<br><br>
"800 per week", according to an Uber driver. "More than 2000 per month, though Uber can subsidize us for a better rate of 1200. But a Tesla is not worth it when you drive part-time. It's for those who can put in 10-12 hours per day".
<br><br>
We wondered how come so many city Ubers use Teslas. The reality is still a very miniscule subset of people own one.

<br><br>

As I thought of the future assets I hope to save up for, I'm slash out Rivian from the list and replace it with an economic car.
<br><br>

Finish Post-Secondary
</h2>
<br>

He knew a plethora of kids of first generation immigrants that don't want to study. This, in contrast to many in the Philippines want to get an education but can't.
<br><br>
"You want to study? Get a loan. You have schools within distance, resources, programs. All you have to do is take it".
<br><br>
As someone finishing, I'd say a diploma is definitely not "up for grabs". It's HARD to get. But for most young people like me, this is good advice because the difficulty of the present veils the the light at the end of the tunnel. It's easier to give up.
<br><br>
"Young people who studied here have all the potential to live and provide a full life. It saddens me that many reject or give up post-secondary, and choose the baseline."
"But when they get older and want to come back to studying, the entry is harder because they have to sacrifice the current jobs that sustain them".
<br><br>
His advice to my brother is, "Study, and whatever happens, finish. If you put in money in a bank, you have something to withdraw. But if you don't put money, there's nothing to withdraw. Put in the work for that diploma. There is no such thing as a shortcut to a good life"
<br><br>
Asian dads do have a good rationale.
<br><br>

Starting from the Bottom is a Blessing
</h2>
<br>

Tito came from a background of poverty, similar to us.
<br><br>
"I would pay a fare and sleep in the train overnight as it goes back and forth, back and forth". We've recently rode the terminals and learned there is no limit on how long you can stay on a train. Back then many did sleep overnight on the trains, but presently it is not safe anymore.
<br><br>
"I only have my clothes and 200 pesos when I moved [to Toronto]. I will go from door to door to find who's hiring. It is my routine everyday for the first two months I was unemployed. I bring an apple or banana with me, sit in a corner to eat, and get up and continue. Sometimes, they don't open the door for me", he chuckles.
<br><br>
I've listened to many stories of my mother's side of the family's rural, agrarian roots to know we aren't truly well-off people.
There is a dilemma that many, more wealthy immigrants face. They've already invested much in their life, position, and assets in their home country, but by going elsewhere they must start fresh. Start from owning zero, start from working entry-level. When they are a well-respected executive and come here to become a grunt task worker, it disheartens them that many return to the Philippines.
But the poor has a different story.
<br><br>
"I came here having nothing. There is I had nothing to lose."
<br><br>
Only infinite room to grow and gain.
<br><br>

Life taught me to Laugh at Layoffs
</h2>
<br>

Tito is a skilled worker who have worked across manufacturing industries since his time in the Philippines.
He had been through many layoffs - too many - that he just laughs at it. Despite it all, they are alive and well. My dad who has been through the same can empathize.
<br><br>
"Maganda ang mapagkumbaba ka lang. Hindi mo pinepersonal lahat" - It's good to be humble and to not take everything personally. 
<br><br>
It's not you that has something wrong. It's many things outside your control. Layoffs just means get up and look elsewhere in this circle of life. Someone else will find value from the skills you bring.
