Welcome to my monthly retrospectives! They are coming back to grace my blog. Whether or not you're a fan of retros, you've been fooled to read and care about a random month in a random dev's life!
<br><br>

Let's begin by talking about my progress in my development projects. Not too much to brag from this wee ordered list.
<ol>
<li> Created a <a href="/resources">Resources</a> page! </li>
<li> Displayed my <a href="/resume">Resume</a> directly on my site </li>
<li> Added a <a href="/andrea">Faves section to my profile</a> </li>
</ol>
<br>

I expected that instead of project velocity, life will take the wheel this month. But it did in quite unexpected ways, therefore, we have sections below which will feel more my like personal journal jottings.
<br><br>

<h2 class='lancelot x-large'>The Mellow May</h2>
<br>

We should call it Melancolic May or Mellow May, because the fallout of Winter is usually fully experienced in springtime at May.
I culminated the most peaceful semester of my university weeks after my first half of family flew to Toronto to scour the city in lieu of my migration.
<br><br>

<br><br>

You'd wonder, is the difference of Toronto from Winnipeg really that wide? <br>
Yes. East-and-West difference. <i>*cackles at dad joke*</i> But truly, despite a difference of one hour, video calls made me witness complete nightfall on my local Toronto sky while a sunny afternoon on Winnipeg's. The tempo of pedestrians and cars, the diversity of people, the food options, the buildings are definitely heightened <i>*coughs*</i> in a megacity.

<br><br>
We remember being at awe of the scenery, the high-rises, company headquarters everywhere. My sister wants to move with me. My brother too, suggesting tongue-in-cheek that he could work as a window glass cleaner. In anticipation, I wrapped my up school year with passion and excitement, but tides have changed. Joy trailed off an edge for a handful of reasons I'd keep private from this blog.
<br><br>

I found myself in the same state as I was last May when I started developing this blogsite. Crafted by a depressed Andrea. Albeit, there's differences on how my last year's depression panned out versus this year's
<br><br>

Last year, depression felt
<ul>
<li> Pumped </li>
<li> Angry </li>
<li> Vindictive </li>
</ul>
<br>

This year, depression felt
<ul>
<li> Calm </li>
<li> Defeated </li>
<li> Peaceful </li>
</ul>
<br>

It is a lethargic, calm, peaceful sorrow. I do not hate myself, I do not hate anyone in the world. I am just.. calm. Sad. Grieving. Receptive. Over the May weeks,
<br><br>

I cannot develop.<br>
I cannot produce any kind of art.<br>
I cannot write blogs, or any form of writing.<br>
I cannot make videos.
<br><br>

It's a saddening state. 
I go day-by-day opening my list of ideas and staring at passion to-do's, but without drive to go forward.
<br><br>

But, I accepted that I went through a hard month and forgive myself for it. My May has been simple. I went out with a few choice people. I prepared for my migration. I decided that my last days in Winnipeg is best spent playing Stardew Valley with my brother.

<br><br>

Sometimes, I play Crusader Kings 3. The game is a recent fave, and I am sharing a blog exploring Crusader Kings 3 and a few of my playthroughs soon!
<br><br>

I know that the emotional trough I feel right now is situational. I don't know what I need, but I trust the entry of June will reinvigorate me once again.
<br><br>

<h2 class='lancelot x-large'>The June Landing</h2>
<br>

My other half of the family's trip to Toronto at June was rocky, but an interesting story for another day.
We visited the location I'd live at. It's in an area away from Downtown, away from crime hotspots, and away from much pedestrian or highway activity. It is a glamorous, sweet spot of the city that I could never have found without God's leading and my mom's help.

<br><br>
After we unpacked the luggages at my new place, me and my mom headed to Fairview mall where my dad and siblings were shopping.
We buffet-style shopped for different pastries from St. Germain's bakery, and sat at a table next to a superstore to taste the variety of bread we picked. 
"I am no longer sad, mom", I exclaimed through tears. "I am very happy!". I realized that despite it all, my God has been good to me.
<br><br>

On Sunday, I bid my farewells to my family. The following day, I started work.
<br><br>

<h2 class='lancelot x-large'>And Onward</h2>
<br>

My first week breezed through. Everyday was sunny and ideal for outside walks, and the urban scenery never failed to take away my breath. My support network spans people in Toronto, people back home in Winnipeg, even people in Winkler where I attended Bible College. I stayed connected, even reconnected with people through text after I made the big leap. I feel so close to everyone while being so away. I feel so comfortable, cared for, even when I'm alone. 
I live the irony of a quiet and content life in a big and beautiful city.

<br><br>
There is joy after sorrow that God gave is inexplicable. As I write this blog on a Friday morning, I am at awe of wonder and I am happy beyond words for what had been the longest time. I was emptied, that I can be filled again. 
I find myself pondering back to the dreams I had before I dedicated myself to full-time university activities. Starting a painting business. Writing a book or graphic novel. Cooking. Learning to drive. There are other things that I'd love to tap into more outside personal coding projects. My evenings are mine, I find time and energy. 
It is high time, prime time, to put a pedal to my dreams!
