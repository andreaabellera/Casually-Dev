I'm sharing artworks that I have commissioned over the summer! They are not my own work, but rather, work created for myself.
In art lingo, <b>commissioning</b> an artist is paying them to produce art, as opposed to buying pre-made drawings, paintings, and prints.
Since art commissions are uniquely tailored to the client's request, they also cost more money and time. The process involves the artist getting back to you with work-in-progress (a.k.a WIPs) in different stages of the drawing until you approve the final work.

In art communities, I actively commissioned my creative buddies and did commissions for some of them too. 
But for the first time, I'm taking my quest on a new platform - Reddit!
<br><br>

I started by picking artists out in the wild in art commission subs such as <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/artcommissions/'>r/artcommissions</a> and <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/HungryArtists/'>r/hungryartists</a>, saving posts as I go. I narrowed my search to two illustrators who are both Filipinos. A coincidence? Probably. Deep-seated heartstrings drawn to the same visual beauty? Potentially. 
Both of them are given the same prompt to draw my self-portrait, but in different scopes.

Commission # 1:<a href='https://www.instagram.com/adobulok/'> Pio </a>
</span>
<br><br>

Pio specializes in vintage monochrome realistic portraits, with a signature "Filipiniana" touch to his works. 
I was strongly drawn to his portfolio and decided to commission him for a colored full-body artwork in his style. 
Pio takes attention to detail, asking for a close-up detail of my dress. He made modifications, making it longer and more majestic. I absolutely love the cottagecore feel of the end result!

Commission # 2:<a href='https://www.instagram.com/wvlfgng03/'> Roma </a>
</span>
<br><br>

When I stumbled across Roma's post, she featured an animated isometric diorama featuring the fam characters from Spy x Family. This is definitely an eye-catcher that stood out for me. I checked her work in Instagram and fell in love with her vibrant painting style. I commissioned her for a bust shot portrait close to my reference image.
Roma may be one of the best artists I worked with, given her quick process, constant feedback, and lovely character. Her works possess a gorgeous essence. Let her finished piece speak for herself!
