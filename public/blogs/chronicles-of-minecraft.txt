This post is dedicated to fawning over my favorite game. Minecraft! 
How some early 20 something gal got into Minecraft is purely a product of many good memories of playing with siblings and friends, rendering it timeless.
If you are a Minecraft enjoyer and looking for a playmate, please do not hesitate sending me a message through LinkedIn challenging  me to a Hypixel duel.
I find the best part of Minecraft is adventuring with friends and the creative satisfaction of making builds. I tend to play Survival more, with Creative only for palette testing.
<br><br>

Here's to sharing some chronicles of playing Minecraft over the years.

<br><br>
<span class='lancelot x-large'> First Contact </span>
<br><br>

My first exposure with Minecraft was as a kid watching my cousins (who seem to have all the games under the sun) play the game. 
At times, I get to borrow their tablet and dabble on a build. The game had not much significance with me then.

In Deviantart, I had a friend circle of fellow artists that are all girls. 
We met each other when the oldest in our group acquainted us all via a comment mention. 
Ever since, we followed and supported each other, communicated daily back through a Discord groupchat, 
and did many activities together - related and unrelated to art.
<br><br>

The oldest in the group bought Minecraft and availed subscription for a Minecraft Realm. Boy, was I excited and got the game as well.
I played with the squad from Day 0, building our first family home tree and knowing little about the game. We all had rooms in the second floor and I appreciated that a friend made me a balcony facing the ocean. Every morning, I will roll my boat from my balcony to hit the vast seas.
I made a stone bridge from fields to mountains to avoid the swamp because I was so scared when a witch threw me a potion.
It was the first world I've been formally part of and played on it quite commitedly even after my friends stopped playing due to a workload increase. After a while, I asked my friend to stop paying for the subscription as no one but only myself plays. I took a full online community hiatus moving to college.

<span class='lancelot x-large'> Elmo's World </span>
<br><br>

When I came back from college, I had a strong urge to play Minecraft again the fine summer before going to university. 
I told my brother, who always wanted to play Minecraft as well so he bought the game. That time, new accounts come with a free 1-month Realm subscription. He made the world and the two of us played for days. 
We called our world Elmo's world and became Elmos.

<br><br>

On the last day of the free subscription, we burned all our builds, freed all the animals, wasted our excess blocks all over our base to play hide-and-seek and kill each other. So fun!

My Deviantart art group got back to Minecraft with the same friend buying the Realms subscription again. We started fresh and what may be our largest and longest-standing world. This time, more of my friends are committed to the game with one to three others online at the daily.
Since our art group are predominantly builders, we never run out of building projects. Each one of us owned kingdoms, mine was a snowy cottage kingdom over extreme hills with stone bridges connecting mountain peaks.

<br><br>

We collaborated on building all the kingdoms and public amenities, we're each others' guests and citizens. 
We also made each other properties as tokens of love, like this one statue which I made for a friend.

<span class='lancelot x-large'> Delphi Island </span>
<br><br>

A group of employees from a small company I interned in decided to make a Minecraft server.
I got to play with another intern from my uni, it was a fun time.

<br><br>
<span class='lancelot x-large'> Origin World </span>
<br><br>

For this world, I played with a friend group of mostly musicians and artists from the US. It used a light modpack that allowed a character to gain quirks and superpowers, but also weaknesses. I was a small bee who can float around in the air, is healed in the presence of flowers, but is unable to cast damage under the moonlight.

<br><br>
<span class='lancelot x-large'> UMMC </span>
<br><br>

Our university has a Minecraft club and public server, which is fantastic! Over the pandemic years, I played every now and then. Sometimes, I'm with friends. Other times, I play independently at leisure. A few times, there are special events where we get to play with different colleges across America.
Currently I am playing with my brother on developing a swampy area close to spawn. I had other friends pass by my humble abode.
