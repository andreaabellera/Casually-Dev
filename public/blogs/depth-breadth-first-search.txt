<b>Depth-first Search (DFS)</b> and <b>Breadth-first Search (BFS)</b> are the two foundational algorithms to traverse a graph. 
This journal entry aims to refresh this concept in a high-level and explore applications of the DFS and BFS in programmatic problem solving!

Imagine your friend is rich and has a mansion. They hold a party giving everyone free $50 Skip gift cards. You don't want to miss the chance to attend.
You arrived there with a car but there's a problem. Because there are so many attendees, there is no spot left in the main parking. 
You would need to find a parking space among the streets close by.

<br><br>

You concur at least one of the streets in the neighborhood has a spot you can park at. How would you search for a parking spot?
You can do it randomly, drive here and there back and forth but that's not effective. None of the cars are leaving so why revisit a streets you already searched?
You'd like to do it systematically, so you made a graph of adjacent streets that are connected.

<span class="x-large lancelot"> Depth-first Search </span>
<br><br>

You take a sequence of streets and follow that route.

<br><br>

If you reach a dead end, you drive back (also known "backtracking") to the last street that has a different path connected that you have not explored yet.
<br><br>

<span class="x-large lancelot"> Breadth-first Search </span>
<br><br>

Because you are smart, you realize you can deploy RoboScouts to search up the area. RoboScouts are tiny robots with cameras that can scout a street for parking and locates new streets connected to it. It summons other Roboscouts to go search up the new street. 
You can only control one RoboScout at a time with your phone.

~~ To be figma'd ~~
DFS is implemented as a stack, while BFS uses a queue.
