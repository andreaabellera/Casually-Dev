Me and my sister who's just 2 years younger went high-roller shopping. Think Sephora, Hudson's Bay. It's all good, everything's in budget!
We thrived through cheap stuff through our years in Canada and it will be nice to return to our universities owning great quality makeup and articles of clothing.
We have decided to switch our approach on purchases from 'many and cheap' into 'few but good quality'.
I treated her makeup, grabbed some for myself as well. 
I've never been this excited for a year of school - which potentially may be my last.  Crazy what three years of isolation can change in ya.
<br><br>

While not much has transpired in terms of development, I'd say that the week off had been quite eventful.
<br>
I replaced all my old makeup, assembling my dream kit.
<br>
I threw away broken shoes, polished and cleaned the ones I'll use for the next months.
<br>
I got a new haircut.
<br>
Found all my missing art supplies.
<br>
Me and my sister decluttered our entire closet and passed clothes to our two younger sisters.
<br>
My other material items got sorted and organized.
<br>
My savings got purposed and I recently opened new investment buckets.
<br>
Solidified plans with clubmates.
<br><br>

Fair to say I have set my assets and my life in order. I added 50+ verses since the last blog so now I'm halfway to 2500.  
The plan now is to get back to those secret projects and fun commits.
<br><br>

Additionally, qtrlex is now CasuallyDev! 
I snagged a new domain, <span class="cousine">casually.dev</span>, which rings so well. Aforementioned Tiktok account will also be known as <span class="cousine">@casuallydev</span> and I'm starting to plan cool stuff to go in there. Right now, my account only has crickets though.
<br><br>

Also, check out this new dump of memes I got to create.

This + three occurences of falling down the stairs. I did not buy it, don't worry
<br><br>

Terminology matters
