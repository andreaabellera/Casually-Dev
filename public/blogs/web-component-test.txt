Hehehehhee whoooo babey check this out! Deez BUTTONS are embedded in the body of my blog.

<casually-button text="I am a cool Light Button"></casually-button>
<br><br>

It has an alternate skin for..

<casually-button skin="asphalt" text="THE DARK MODE ENJOYERS"></casually-button>
<br><br>

And it also comes in an alternate shape!
<casually-button shape="wedge" text="Napakasakit kumonekta sa socket na masakit"></casually-button>
<casually-button shape="wedge" skin="asphalt" text="Nakukuryente kita kapag ako'y nakakabit ‚ö°"></casually-button>
<br><br>

They are actual buttons. Try it. Click on them! 
<br><br>

They'll take you to Casually UI's repository where these buttons are being developed üòä
<br><br>

As fantastic as it is to see them in action, it reminds me that I have a long list of refinements to go before publishing them to the wild.
<br><br>

If you're one of the lucky ones,
<br> where the text or graphics is 
<br> overflowing off the screen
<br> on your mobile phone,
<br>
<br> Bear with me.
