Casually Roadshows will be a token term for promotional shorts of my projects. I have my first (pogrammatically speaking Zeroeth) Roadshow live. It's a teaser for my project, Casually CSS - a summer dream now come true!
Check out my Youtube video and give a thumbsup if you love it!

I've dabbled on music creation software like FLStudio, but the process had been a tough learning curve and the free version doesn't allow me to load saved projects.
<br><br>

Until.. my siblings downloaded <b>My Singing Monsters</b>. One way we siblings bond is by playing mobile games together. Brawl Stars is one of them, normally I would be joining but I've stayed away from it this summer. I am a huge Brawl Stars enjoyer (Love maining Darryl, Rosa, or Spike) but it can be such a time sink.
Speaking about this My Singing Monsters game, boy, I haven't touched the game in 5 years and I miss it. Last we had it, my grandma from the Philippines was vacationing here in Canada and she chants the monster tunes with us. So I downloaded it - for the fun, for bonding, but also for a great idea!
<br><br>

One of the islands in the game is called the Composer Island. There, I can use the Singing Monsters' voices to compose my own tunes. Some monsters don't sing but they play instruments. So some monsters have drums, strings, and if I have the skills, they can collectively become a literal orchestra.
I've never thought I'd make my Casually CSS jingle on a mobile game but here we are. Want to see the monsters behind the scenes?

<b>Confession:</b> I am musically illiterate and don't know how to compose proper music.
<br><br>

<b>Compensating for my lack of skill, I'd Hire Composers:</b> I would love to commission musically adept colleagues or friends to create short jingles and tunes.
