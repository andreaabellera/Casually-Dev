Look, it's me! Our UM Today website published the <a href="https://news.umanitoba.ca/meet-the-2022-emerging-leader-award-winners-undergraduate/">list of Emerging Leaders for 2022</a> for exceptional leaders in my university and I am graced to see my name on there. 
I got a sweet certificate on my table whenever I feel so inclined to look back to a dramatic year. 
But God has been good to my soul.

<br><br>

Let me tell you how to get this award. Give yourself 2 head positions in student clubs in a simulteneous period of time. Actually make programs and events happen. 
Get the reference of an esteemed university instructor and one peer. There you have it.
<br><br>

While it was nice to be part of many things, the experience had not been all sunshine. Yes, even from me, who is a smiley, bubbly, yellow-hue lover who's slogan is <i>bonne nouvelle journ√©e</i> and appears all sunshine.
This will be one of my more open-heart blogs in qtrlex. There will be hard and venty parts but I'd keep them controlled and in moderation.
<br><br>

You can cast a ray on this certificate and behind it is the shadow of what it took. Objectively, volunteering had done more good things than bad. 
I developed great friendships, built a tough skin, learned the hard side of the world, and availed me the chance to impact the lives of many beneficially. 
I remember the time I went to a Starbucks and the barista serving me, after I scanned my app card, asked if I was Andrea from MISA. I am! And she was one of business students in our Discord server who asked me for help regarding the MIS program. 
After years of talking to avatars, it's been an extremely exciting moment to meet someone I helped in person (and graced me and a homie with a very delicious drink too!)
<br><br>

I am not all sunshine. I was an Emerging Monster. I saw sides of me that I had not seen before, that I did not know existed until all this hiring, firing, soliciting, cold-calling, logistics, scheduling, marketing, merch ordering, orientations, meetings, running workshops, endorsing, team building, support, tutoring, mentorship, negotiating, and downright freaking fighting.
<br><br>

Well Andrea, it's no doubt that if you're handling many things on top of your classes, you'd be stressed. 
Yes, I did stretch myself thin. So that others (all those type-A kids or sad kids that I'm in league with) won't be stretched thin. I chose it, I expected it. But the emotional toll of lack of support, of falling out, I did not choose nor expect. 
I've always thought of myself a supportive sidekick to my friends who actually want to get out there, not the leader-type. But over time, either passion, devotion or competence made me one.
<br><br>

<span class="gentiumBasic x-large"><i>The shadow of the award is pain</i></span>
<br><br>

It did not show the people I hurt. It did not show the people I supported but ended up breaking. Intentions from goodwill, eager to give my friends who are hurting some redemption, but my pride was a vicious criminal.
<br><br>

It did not show the lonely roads, the heartbreaks, the VWs. There was non-communication, neglect of responsibility but more aggressively, there were also accusations, gaslighting, verbal discouragement, destructive criticism, disrespect, and persuading my team to turn against me. 
January was sad. February was painful. 
March and April were sad and painful.
<br><br>

My closest friend at the time called me a sh*tty leader. I entrusted to him my vulnerabilities not knowing that he will exploit it himself.
<br><br>

I'm not a victim. I'll make this clear. This friend is a good person, if not with tons of pride as myself.
I had equal sass and aggression towards him over the classic morning repar-tea. In private, it was fine, until our attacks became public.
<br><br>

I was aware of the Emerging Monster brewing inside me. I told my closest friend at that time, after being broken by him as well, that I do not know if I should run for anything next year. I only hurt people because that's what I do. But on the flip side, I also wanted a leadership role. I want redemption and another chance to do things better.
<br><br>

One lesson that I had to learn, the most difficult of all, is that I should respect myself enough to let go of friends that drag me down. Including the closest ones.
