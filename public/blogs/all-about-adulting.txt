Moving out availed me to burn the bridges behind me. But on a lighter note, Moving out means I have my own space now. Hurray!

We can't blame employers because the youngins do wreak havoc. But they don't speak of it. It's a two-way mistake.

Time to reward myself with some cool office <s>expenses</s> swaggity swag instead. Who doesn't love a few tongue-in-cheek nerdy merch that the actual devs in your office will cringe at? I do.
<br><br>

I can't begin describing how much I love this shirt. Hihi, notice me SM-sama. Let me wear this to my funeral casket to my grave.

As for mugs, there's so much to choose!! Like that "Dad is a programmer. What does your dad do?", "Code like a Girlboss", or broken coffee refill code. But let me show you what I'm buying.
<br><br>

Because, I can't argue against this mug roasting me.

<h2 class='lancelot x-large'> All About Adulting (Serious) </h2>
<br>

There is no reason to dread adulting as an adult. It is an exciting new chapter of life and I welcomed it with open arms. The transition was not difficult.. anti-climatically. It was a mere rewiring of routine, budgets, and habits. But the more significant part of adulting is the emotional and mental aspect of gaining security and gravity. I am one composed woman, albeit with an intermittent tendency to meme or blog it out.
<br><br>

<h3 class='taviraj'>Small steps; Giant leaps</h3>
<br>

I uninstalled Discord (still hop sometimes to play co-op games with my siblings), and deleted my Reddit. 
<br><br>

I'm tired. 
<br><br>

They had their time to serve me well, but now I called it time to leave. This is not the first time I deserted online presences. I did it for Deviantart. I did it for my Instagram. I did it for mobile games that I'm a clan leader for. Time will come that I realize these micro-online commitments are doing my life more bad than good. 
The biggest change now is that I no longer spend time to investigate people's digital footprints. I stopped checking profiles, checking likes, follows, who does the Discord emotes under a message, and any pseudo-indication of another person's approval or pseudo-measures of my performance. I am happy to still update my cave, even if as I would say akin with a social site, "I am not active", it's alright. I've accepted that being less active online means I am more active elsewhere. Indeed, it has been the case. It's healthy and good to leave things that I'm unhealthily obsessed with.
<br><br>

<h3 class='taviraj'>Oh, to be Young</h3>
<br>

Us university students stress about one overarching matter - the barrier to entry to a job. A subset want to be academics and make university their career, but for most, we want a stable income so that we can support <span class="cousine small"> &lt;insert after school-goals here&gt; </span>
<br><br>

Usually they are
<br>
<ol>
<li>Get a job</li>
<li>Get a house</li>
<li>Get a wife (husband in my case)</li>
<li>Get a life</li>
</ol>
<br>

There's a funny trend before and after entry - that once you're in, everything that came before is out. Your university colleagues don't ask your Grade 12 Physics grade, but that was a big deal back in high school. As a university student, you introduce relevant and relatable matters to your fellows. You state your year, specializations, and school you go to if you're in an intercollegiate event. Optionally, you share some hobbies and what cool tech you're currently into.
<br><br>

But once you're in the workplace, we only briefly indicate our educational background. <b><i>"I studied Computer Science, with a side of business."</i></b> That's it. 4+ years of tears and fears, summarized in a single line. Nobody asks you to prove it, nobody throws you on a whiteboard technical test, demands you to pull a certification or show your Github or Leetcode streaks, or asks for the name of your school and whether it's in the top 10 Canadian colleges in 2023, or asks for what societies you joined, what startups you had, and whether you had a friend group or not. Instead, you share your current role and how you bring value to the team. Optionally, how long you were in the company and the team, and what roles you held prior.
<br><br>

It is surreal. Life is a book and that page is past. The <b>world in university</b> and the <b>world beyond university</b> are vastly different. I'm in an interesting spot where I am in both of them right now. But the latter world is real.
<br><br>

I cannot chastise my younger self, I can only reminisce and say, <i>Oh, to be young!</i> 
<br>

<ul>
<li>To be young is to believe that life is a race</li>
<li>To be young is to be scared of falling behind</li>
<li>To be young is to be threatened when something's not in your favor</li>
<li>To be young is to be scared that as a girl, you are in an industry full of boys - when they are equally just as scared</li>
<li>To be young is to be be threatened by the old, while the old is threatened by the young</li>
<li>For the poor envious of the rich, the rich scared of the poor's envy</li>
<li>Concerned that there is too much of your kind that you are hated, or too little of your kind that you are alienated</li>
<li>To be young is to feel defeated after being given a "no"</li>
<li><b>To be young is to lament the things we don't have yet</b></li>
</ul>
<br>

It opened my heart to know ladies with entirely different stories from mine. Some are caregivers, tending to the children and the elderly. Some work three minimum wage jobs to sustain themselves as a student in Toronto. Some can only dream to be a Canadian. Some would wish they have better health. I am a Canadian citizen with good health as of writing this, implying that some people can only dream to have the things I have. 
<br><br>

Furthermore, there are single ladies and men who bought their own townhouses, but have none to share it with. There are married couples who are still finding an apartment unit they can call their own.
<br><br>

<b>Oh, that we can combine people into one that they may be complete.</b>
<br><br>

But it doesn't work that way.
<br><br><br>

<i>
<span class='slightLarge'>
"For we are saved by hope: but hope that is seen is not hope: for what a man seeth, why doth he yet hope for?"
</span>
<br>
<span class='slightSmall'>- Romans 8:24 </span>
</i>
<br><br>

It is better to lack because there is something to look forward to. It is better to lack to not be full. There is something you can count on God for, acknowledge Him for, hoping against hope, that He is a God of His word and He will fulfill it.
<br><br>

I asked my <a href="/blog/life-taught-me">Toronto tito</a> what else he looks forward to in his 60's - "All I want is peace, and to have conversations like this."
<br><br>

<h2 class='lancelot x-large'> Remote Work Life </h2>
<br>

As much as I'd like to say I'm working from a yacht in Lake Ontario sniffing the sea air under a lightly-clouded sunny sky, simple is nice.
<br><br>

Here in Toronto, libraries are the communally accepted remote co-working space. I have a library in walking distance. The facility is nice with lots of working stations. I would see kids come in waves, but also noticeable is the amount of older students and professionals happily camping in the cubbies.
<br><br>

I've come to love those cubbies.
<br><br>

You have dead silence and then you'll suddenly hear someone blurt, "Yes, the contract is vital. Agreed."
<br><br>

Or someone's phone go out, "I'm a Barbie girl, in a Barbie wooorld."
<br><br>

The best part is you can sit for hours and hours on end and won't ever feel that you'd be kicked out, as opposed to cafes which go full house on lunch times. Parks are great, space is not a problem, maintenance of these are funded well. Kids - especially TORONTO kids - don't go to parks nowadays so there's always a bench to grab where you can sit soaking the sun alone in silence. Parks here are also very well-maintained too! But it's not always <i>en saison</i> to go to the park, so seize it while the forecast is in your favor. 
<br><br>

Though most days, I stay home. It's the nature of the work content, but also, homemade economical 3-in-1 coffee is so good. Taking one day at a time, waking up to 3-in-1 coffee ☕ or a Hazukido croissant 🥐 is the experience I'm here for!
<br><br>
