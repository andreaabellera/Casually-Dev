Sometimes visitors would come to our house and dine. I would be coding across the living room where my work table is, large swaths of html and browser logs 80% of the time. Siblings say it's my hobby. Internally grinning, I wonder: who in the world has coding for a hobby? I have literal artworks also up in literal frames which parents point to me as harbinger of.
Pfft classic nerd. My work and projects require it, don't blame meeee.
<br><br>

I am to be blamed, my dedication to Casually CSS was a fault. 
Sometimes, I would play the orchestrator reel. 
My brother thinks my Hippo is cute. He called my Bison ugly. But we call each other ugly all the time. 
Ugly is a compliment. A term of endearment of the highest order. My parents have since then been desensitized.
Seriously though, if you find my artworks ugly tell me :P (nicely, with feedback/suggestions please) so I can make them better.

<br><br>

Meanwhile, I designed my artworks to take in props.
Props, in Casually CSS, is a string, number or object that you pass to hack an artwork. Just like parameters. 
If you are familiar with a some art pieces, such as iconic Hippo, passing a bodyColor and eyeColor will change these attributes in the artwork.
<br><br>

E.g. <br>
<span class="cousine">
Hippo bodyColor='pink' eyeColor='green'  
</span>
<br>
will give you a pink hippo with green eyes.
<br><br>

Components, in Casually CSS, are artworks themselves. Place them as many times as you want and it will add the artwork code at the locations you dictate it to be.
For my site, I want to launch Hippos across the screen. But one is not enough. I want 5 hippos.
<br><br>

<span class="cousine">
Hippo bodyColor='pink' eyeColor='green' <br>
Hippo bodyColor='pink' eyeColor='green' <br>
Hippo bodyColor='pink' eyeColor='green' <br>
Hippo bodyColor='pink' eyeColor='green' <br>
Hippo bodyColor='pink' eyeColor='green' <br>
</span><br>

or programatically,
<br><br>

<span class="cousine">
{#each Array(5)}
    Hippo bodyColor='pink' eyeColor='green'
{/each}
</span>
<br><br>

In summary, I've been making a circus.
<br><br>

I have started the teaser video for Casually CSS! It's all under the repo 'svelte-frame-orchestrator.'
What I lack in video editing skills, I'd make up with coding. This helper project aims to 'play' a sequence of component frames in an interval, akin to a slideshow. 
Instead of document slides like PowerPoint, or video frames like .mp4 clips, you can play no-reload webpages.
<br><br>

My next quest is to make a jingle. I've never made beats or music before but I'm eager to learn.
I'm going to refine my frames some more when the jingle is ready, I'd definitely make a post when the teaser's out!
