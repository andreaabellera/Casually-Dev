I drove myself mad finding the perfect<span class="small"><b>TM</b></span> server for qtrlex. Different routers, Express, Polka and Sapper all inflicted pain. SvelteKit had come so, so close! It gave me problems with the navigator object which I need for mobile compatability.
I discovered Routify last minute and was blown away by its no-frills routing. It handled even dynamic routes! I was sad when the deploy failed to work so I skipped sleep to debug very obscure Node errors. It turns out I've just been deploying from a wrong build folder. Thankfully, I have a stack that works now, migrating from a Svelte-Rollup app to a Routify-Svelte-Vite app. Bless Routify.

The last nail in the head is fetching content from the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) for the fully-decentralized blog of my dreams. I discovered IPFS last Winter semester and worked with it on a project while I fell into the Web3 rabbit hole.
I've been getting the package from npm but it threw Electron and browser compatability errors. Fortunately, I found a dev from Github who used a pre-packed module that works. With images, I use the IPFS storage in Fleek.co, while the blog content is fetched from IPFS core. It takes a bit to initialise but once it's up, all content is there!

Interestingly, IPFS is the first async in my site. Propagating data to the beloved frontend components while keeping the UX reasonable is the new challenge. 
For now, there's loading boxes but I'd do a favor and make more fun loading components. Perhaps, put my Journal feature row at the top of my site but journals have stayed empty content-wise.

Yep, I've been delaying my first journal. I'm a lazy dumdum. I already study bare minimum at school, so, here's to motivation for pushing myself to a journalling routine! Wish this unstudious person well. Since I put my energy to this site, I am sooo ready for a retro which I am writing simultaneously with this blog. <br><br>See it tomorrow in June 1!
