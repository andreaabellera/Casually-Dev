Hey it's time for the far overdue summer-end retrospective!
August was a wild month, there are so many stories I do not know where to start. 
Now, that I've stalled it and two weeks into school, I have even more stories!

The release train on its last lap but there is a boulder on the track. 
The train crashes at the boulder, sending segments off in every direction, 
but each fragment, surprisingly, landed on a track and took a route of its own. 
That's August and the start of September, my friends, thank you.
<br><br>

Will I consider August a success in terms of my project velocity? Nope.
I barely did any development or studying. But in terms of value, yes.

This retrospective will be different, more of life journalling than a sprint touchdown

On Life
</span>
<br><br>

I accepted a full-time offer after graduation that involves moving to another province. It's interesting to process given a year of school left. At this point, being a student is no longer an endeavour, but a motion or act to finish.
I expressed to a friend that graduating gave me mixed feelings. I love being a student. I wore this tag my entire life. The benefits of a student - our routine, activities, privileges - now seem very finite. While processing how it's not like to be a student is wild, moving provinces permanently is the most bittersweet part. The year I went to Bible College, I huddled with my family as they dropped me at my dorm. But it was for only one year and they can visit me in less than two hours' drive. 
This time, they have to board a pricey plane (or most likely I do!) My family has always been close knit, helping each other extensively, serving in church together. But now lingers the fact that next year, I may no longer be a student and no longer living with family. It will be a massive change but that bridge will be crossed. The opportunity is great, we're all happy beyond words.

On Art
</span>
<br><br>

This month, my art had a srevival. I participated on my artist group's exclusive mini Artfight - cleverly called the minimart fight! Instead of two teams, it was a free-for-all and we get scored for attacking anyone. 
This event made me produce art which I have not done for a long time. With my tablet and touchscreen out-of-order, I cooked up pixel sprites with a mouse.

On Drinks, Expenses, Lifestyle
</span>
<br><br>

I tried many new drinks! I got their pictures wrote new reviews. However, this month, I rarely went out for drinks. I made more coffee from home and realized I like it better this way. I started operating on budgets, deducting every expense against an upper limit. My taste on items changed and heightened. I buy small knickknacks less. I used to always have a "dream" piece of clothing, but now, clothes lost its appeal.
Over the summer, I got comfortable with sneakers as I took them to long walks. It's funny because sneakers are considered the most practical footwear but I used to not like wearing them. They do not offer the elevation that heels do. When going out with people, I always HAVE to go in heels because I'm embarassed of being short. This month, I started going out with people in sneakers. I.. call this a big lifestyle change.

This is the date I reached 2500 verses memorized by heart. 500 verses in less than 4 months - an impossible summer goal. 
Each day, I sought for a balm to my heart. I had uplifting highs, but still had crushing lows.
It is to teach me and make me humble, broken, repent.
<a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Proverbs-Chapter-14/">Proverbs 14</a>, <a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Proverbs-Chapter-15/">15</a>, <a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/James-Chapter-3/">James 3</a>. I saw myself in these passages and it is a dagger through the heart.
I come this year with a new mindset - to float above. Float above disappointment, float above fights, float above approval or validation, float above envy, float above ambition, float above beating myself up for not finishing enough despite having done too much. Commit things beyond my control to God. The flowers around my wrist are a testimony that while I wear them, I cannot be angry.
<br><br>

<a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Psalms-Chapter-7/">Psalms 7</a>, <a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Psalms-Chapter-51/">51</a> and <a href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Lamentations-Chapter-3/">Lamentations 3</a> talks of the needful penalty of bearing the consequences of sin, but also the consummation of judgement.
Even in repentance and faithfulness, there is still a period of wait.

It's also the date I started working out again after many years. Workouts have been replaced by walks and activities in university to compensate.
