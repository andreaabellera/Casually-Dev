Life is so quick and so much is being done. I've been <s>failing to write blogs</s> enjoying things as they come. Friday's a gal's hangout day. This is will be a small entry to ease-in.
<br><br>

With so many new things achieved and revived missions and experiences, I'm going to restrain myself from turning this entry into a retrospective - that's for next month.
Instead, I'd be making a few blog posts the following days!

A puppy lives in our house for the time being while her owners are on a trip. Everyday, the puppy will leap onto my couch bed and snuggle by me. 
She does it around 6-7am, constantly, just about the time I need to stir up to work for the day.

She'll sleep on my blanket for 3 hours straight at morning while my fam is away and house is the quietest. We're not the owners so no pic, have this pupper instead.

I also learned dogs love basking under the sunlight. Indeed, I am dog.

Of a random forethought, there is a mobile game series called "I Became a Dog", which is honestly one of the best one-shot games I've played. 
The first one especially is a ground-shaker. You are a dog, eat dog food to understand dog language, and live through dog drama. At the end, you may or may not become a human again. 
It has slightly dark undertones but nonetheless intriguing and satisfying.
