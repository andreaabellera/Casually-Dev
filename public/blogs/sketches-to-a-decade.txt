The site's La Ruelle Charmante is nearly done, with my last challenge coding in the timeline. In that page, I celebrate my learning, achievements, and hardships over the last 3 years of university.
Yes, celebrate my hardships. I see pain as part of the beauty that life offers. You can tell from my blog posts that I recall past stories like a dream and at the same time, retrospect critically.
I love to reflect on and revisit the past. I reread the messages I sent people. View my old artworks, writings, photos, videos, listen to my voice clips. All without cringing. I believe this helps me discover where I am and how I can do better.
La Ruelle captures its essence - a journey on a Charming Road watching how I grew, or changed, or remained.

You can say I am the type to wear my heart on my sleeve. This may or may not have came back to bite me but hey, there's sparkle in my eyes, fire in my heart, that refuses to die and only fuelled stronger when people stab me behind.

I have girl caved since forever. My mom said I started at 2 and won't stop drawing animals doing human activities, like playing chess and fishing for birds in the sky.
Today, I am 23. Ten years ago, I am 13. 
Roughly at the time, I discovered <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/">Deviantart</a>. It's unlike modern social media which is mostly show and tell - very dry, limited, and unfulfilling. In the earlier days of the web, social sites are communities.
Deviantart is one of them. I made an account by the name of <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/lyfalle">Lyfalle</a>.
This is also the timeline I started drawing anime, an influence from my HS seatmate (an artist girl too) who I drew comics with on class downtime. 
I got an instant surge of inspiration seeing other users draw anime and post their work on the site so I started doing the same!
<br><br>

I left my old account and started a second Deviantart in my later teens named <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/meuly">Meuly</a>. There I met my online artist friend circle. We're still intact but we're now adults with professional and uni-battered lives.
Eventually we all left Deviantart after a proprietary force bought the site. I moved to Instagram as <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aviagulcas/">Aviagulcas</a> and participated in the one-month <a href="https://artfight.net/~RevelledEminence">Artfight</a> but the community experience is nowhere close as it had been.
<br><br>

Then pandemic happened. I started volunteering for student groups and working remotely with operations fully online. My creative energy all went into crafting Instagram posts, graphic assets, mockups. Then, I discovered I'm completely unable to draw for myself again.
I call this a 3-year long artblock. Sketches are the best I can make nowadays but I'm happy with them. Here are some comics some few days ago. All are inspired from my original story but the panel sequences are unrelated and context is non-existent. Have fun!

And THIS. Especially. I hope to redraw this digitally.

Development has taken forefront as my new and expedient creative outlet. Nonetheless, art lives in me forever.
So is Github my new girl cave now? Yes and No. I love that it's a community of devs and just like Deviantart, has 1000x more value than social media. Similarly, I get inspired seeing people build and share their projects. I've used Github for more than 2 years now for school projects, personal projects, sharing workshop code, yet I still feel alien from the open-source community of mostly intimidating smart guys. Girls like me are stupid and my existence on this platform to write blogs, color CSS hippos, and rate coffees is a joke. BUTTT I persist.
<br><br>

Aww Man, I should go around and look for problems on other people's code so I can be a valuable part of the community. Totally the opposite of what an artist would do. I want to go on an Issues section and rave on how cool a project is - if I can haha. Sometimes, I wish there's a way for devs to appreciate each other on top of an endless cycle of business-as-usual: new-feat bug fix-broken-fix problem-solved deployed repeat.

Usually, we talk about an older self being proud for getting to where their younger self once dreamed. If I can revisit my 7-year old past and tell her, "I make websites and games now", she will be elated.
But I'd like to say it true in the retrospect. I am proud of my younger self. Her curious nature, the fire in her heart, the love of sharing uplifting words and using her talents for good. I am happy that I was her, and that I am still her.
She had her insecurities, emotions with major life events <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/lyfalle/posts">documented on Lyfalle's posts</a>. I'd want to tell her, who was once shy and distant, that she has real life friends now. Yet, like her, is still a busy bee who's anxious of returning to school. Shoot! That never changed.
