One hot Sunday, I purposefully walked out at 40 degrees Celsius heat and running just on coffee and hot wings. My body did not appreciate that. I woke up sick to death reminding me that I am human.

This post is dedicated to fawning over my favorite game. Minecraft! 
How some early 20 something gal is into Minecraft was purely a product of so many good memories of playing with siblings and friends.
If you are a Minecraft enjoyer and looking for a playmate, please do not hesitate sending me a message through LinkedIn challenging  me to a Hypixel duel.
I find the best part of Minecraft is adventuring with friends and the creative satisfaction of making builds. I tend to play Survival more, with Creative only for palette testing.

Here's to sharing some chronicles of playing Minecraft over the years with images.

As an elementary/Phil high school kid
I found Minecraft for the first time by watching cousins play the game. When I happen to borrow an ipad, I dabble with a few builds.
I have not played much. Over the years, me and my siblings are enjoying its 2D counterpart that is free, Blockheads.

Home Tree
Is the first world I have been formally part of. The oldest in our group pays for the Realms subscription.


Elmo's World
Me and my brother. On the last day of the free subscription, we burned all our builds, wasted all our blocks to turn the world into lunatic's dream. Played hide-and-seek and killed each other repeatedly.

dAFam
Largest and longest-standing world.

Origin Modpack
Played with friends from the US. I lost pictures.

UMMC
Played with university friends.

Currently I am playing with my brother on developing a swamp area.
