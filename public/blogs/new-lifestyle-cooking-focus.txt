The most exciting change I looked forward to with living independently is that I'll start cooking. I haven't had the chance to cook while in university, enamored with my stress-inflicted diet of instant ramen and coffee. Moving to a larger city posed yet a larger surplus of instant meals and takeouts, but what pleasantly surprised me is an instant shift in habit that required almost no discipline, nor provided resistance, to dispel - Because the desire for something new is so great.
<br><br>

I visited Starbucks once the past month. I started making my homemade refreshers and lattes. I haven't bought a pack of instant noodles since.
<br><br>

Recipe books had a newfound charm. I started picking them up in my library or home visits. I've read up on different styles of preparations, variations of sauces in cultural cuisines, or simply bask on the wonders of how food is made.
<br><br>

I discovered a new outlet.

<h2 class='lancelot x-large'> Sous Chef: The Motivation </h2>
<br>

The best thing I can do as I live on my own is to invest in balanced eating and gradual learning. Food is universal, an important component of life. It impacts not only one's health, but also one's daily mood, energy, and well-being. Only after the past month did I realize I missed out from incorporating fresh food in my routine. Cooking (and the corresponding clean up afterwards) is time consuming, but definitely life-changing.
<br>
<ol>
<li> It's an essential life skill I'll take with me forever </li>
<li> I can control what food goes inside me and plan a balanced diet </li>
<li> It will reduce my expenses significantly </li>
</ol>
<br>

There's something therapeutic about meal planning that begins all the way from grocery shopping. It's fun to compare prices, collect food, pack them in a bag, and carry them home.
<br><br>

Above all, I've learned cooking is the same deal as starting a project or painting. You strategize, plan, procure, execute, bookkeep. I would admit to my younger self that I've been enjoying the process more than the product when all my life I thought it the other way around. Or maybe.. concede in guilt that my end products still need a tad lot of improvement.
<br><br>

<h2 class='lancelot x-large'> Sous Chef Criteria </h2>
<br>

My goal is inspired by Stardew Valley's achievement - "Cook 25 different recipes". This accurately quantifies my goal by September. I'd like to create and name 25 dishes that I have cooked successfully. They can be recipes or followed, or recipes I improvised - but I learned improvisation with guidance tend to be my route most taken. The following are my criteria for entering a dish to the Sous Chef Registry.
<br><br>

<h3 class='taviraj large'> I. It is composed of fresh ingredients </h3>
<br>

As a rule of thumb, fresh ingredients are items that I pick up from the produce, seafood, livestock, poultry, or dairy section of a grocery or a market. Most of the time, they are paid for by weight. They are goods that are a little more perishable than their preserved counterparts.
<br><br>

Canned, preserved or processed goods, frozen pre-made, instant meals, instant mixes, and MSG flavorings aren't fresh ingredients. If the ratio for non-fresh components equals or exceeds the fresh ingredients, I will not consider my meal for the registry.
<br><br>

There is leeway on starch, breads, store-bought broths and cooking sauces or pastes because buying them is more economical than producing them from scratch, which may require a luxury of money, time, specialized ingredients, or more eaters.
<br><br>

<span class="small"><i>As much as I'd like beef stock from the bone, Man, they're expensive!</i></span>
<br><br>

<h3 class='taviraj large'> II. It is a balanced, complex meal </h3>
<br>

A serving of boiled broccoli won't be called a meal. With a slab of beef steak? Almost. But now with a side of potatoes and gravy? Now, that's a hearty meal!
<br><br>

As a rule of thumb, a Sous chef entry will have these components
<br>
<ol>
<li> Meat </li>
<li> Starch </li>
<li> Veggies or fruits </li>
<li> Sauce, spices, and/or garnishings </li>
</ol>
<br>

<h3 class='taviraj large'> III. It is edible, delicious, and I can finish it </h3>
<br>

It doesn't need to be perfect, but I'd have to be able to finish all of it without getting inappetitic or throwing away big portions of the food. I learned that delicious meals are a bonus in a way that they are enjoyed when repeated - so I'd finish them faster. Finishing all the servings I cooked marks the success of the dish! When food goes bad before it's gone, it's game over.

<h2 class='lancelot x-large'> How's it's going so far </h2>
<br>

I have <span class="large"><b>6</b></span>/25 entries in my Registry! I'm going to reveal them in my upcoming delayed June 2023 Retrospective. 
<br><br>

But because being a novice home cook doesn't go by without disasters, I'm going to feature a few cooking diaries to share the reality of the experience so far. Thankfully, none of these disasters involve burning, cuts, or a bad stomach.
<br><br>

<h2 class='lancelot x-large'> Diary #1: MaaS - Meals as a Sacrifice </h2>
<br>

I treated cooking a lot like coding - with little patience to follow measures by the book. I would skim by the tutorials and try to get the gist. I prefer to put my hands, imagination, and knowledge on the spot. Trying. Succeeding. Failing.
<br><br>

"Soy Sauce!"
<br><br>

"Ground pepper!"
<br><br>

"Garlic Powder!"
<br><br>

"Chili Flakes!"
<br><br>

Boomed macho Tiktok chef voice. But instead, it is me - The Sus Chef. Pouring loads of spices and condiments in a desperate attempt to troubleshoot my concoction and make it half edible.
<br><br>

"A little more salt!" *throws in two tablespoons*
<br><br>

<i>Back mind: Andrea, that's a personal-sized dish..</i>
<br><br>

Like bug fixing, sometimes, it doesn't get better. Rather, it can become worse, more buggy, and when you're dealing with food, it can ruin beyond repair. 
<br><br>

I pillowed my head at night, pondering about yet another meal down the garbage chute. "These are ingredients that I bought with money I budgeted", I thought. Several things in life I regret, and a few dollars is a tiny fraction of them. I conceded as I mentally plotted my next meal for breakfast, "It is a necessary sacrifice."
<br><br>

<h2 class='lancelot x-large'> Diary #2: Communist Bugs Bunny says, "Our Kitchen" </h2>
<br>

The first thing I did not expect about living in a shared unit is how quickly I became bashful about taking up space. I live with different kinds of people. The homeowners with their small children, a young woman my age, her mother, and grandmother that visits at times. We all share the same kitchen, dinner table, and fridge. I've been in a big family, I've been in a Bible college dorm with many ladies, but this is different. We are more or less strangers. We all get along - but certainly more self-conscious when it comes to space.
<br><br>

I've extended my optimizing challenge from healthy budgeting to include more criteria. I want to take as little time on the kitchen, make as little waste as I can, take as small a space in the fridge as possible, and avoid collisions on hours I observe others actively use the kitchen. While a paying tenant, I'd choose to be considerate to a fault than insensitive to a fault. I clean up everything as I cook as I eat. I haven't left a utensil on the sink. I wipe dry my batches and others' batches when I can.
<br><br>

Yet, while I was clearing the drying counter, I dropped one of the homeowner's porcelain bowls. It smashed on the floor to thousands of shards.
<br><br>

<i>"Sige, ako na ang <a href="https://pinoyidioms.blogspot.com/2012/05/hindi-makabasag-pinggan.html">makabasag pinggan</a>"</i>, I thought in irony as I swept up every trace of that bowl. I do not wish for anyone to be hurt especially the little kids. I bought a replacement bowl from Homesense after my work as identical as it possibly could, but not quite. I admitted and got extra careful from then. 
<br><br>

<br>

<span class="small"><i>Above: Stock image, not the actual broken bowl</i></span>
<br><br>

There was one day the can opener went mysteriously missing, and I won't snoop around rooms to find who has it. Needless, I'm desperately inequipped to open my mushroom soup. My pasta and chicken are already cooked. I need it so bad. I took a legitimate trip to the mall to get a can opener.
<br><br>

In all cases, vigilance is priority to avoid the bigger disasters like fires. The condominium I live in are many peoples' homes. 
<br><br>

Being a home cook is a fun lifestyle to adopt, but it does come with many considerations and limitations.
